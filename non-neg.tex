\section{Toponogov's splitting}

Recall that a line in a metric space is a geodesic which is minimizing on each segment. 

Let $\spc{X}$ be a metric space and $A,B\subset \spc{X}$.
We will write 
\[\spc{X}=A\oplus B\]
If there projections $\proj_A\:\spc{X}\to A$ 
and 
$\proj_B\:\spc{X}\to B$
such that 
\[\dist[2]{x}{y}{}=\dist[2]{\proj_A(x)}{\proj_A(y)}{}+\dist[2]{\proj_B(x)}{\proj_B(y)}{}\]
for any two points $x,y\in \spc{X}$.

Note that if 
\[\spc{X}=A\oplus B\]
then 
\begin{itemize}
\item $A$ intersects $B$ at single point,
\item both sets $A$ and $B$ are convex; i.e., any minimizing geodesic joining points in $A$ ($B$) lies in $A$ (correspondingly $B$).
\end{itemize}




\begin{thm}{Toponogov's splitting theorem}\label{thm:splitting} 
Let $\spc{L}\in\CBB{}0$ 
and $\gamma$ be a line in $\spc{L}$. 
Then 
\[\spc{L}=X\oplus \gamma(\RR)\]
for some subset $X\subset \spc{L}$.
\end{thm}

For smooth $2$-dimensional surfaces, 
this theorem was proved by Cohn-Vossen in \cite{cohn-vossen_line}.
For the Riemannian manifolds of higher dimensions 
it was proved by Toponogov in \cite{toponogov-globalization+splitting}.%
\footnote{Further deep generalizations of this theorem in Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian manifolds are due to Cheeger--Gromoll and Eshenburg, but these are are far from the scope of this book.}
Then it was generalized by Milka in  \cite{milka-line}
to Alexandrov's spaces, almost the same prove is given in \cite[1.5]{BBI}.
The Milka's proof is a beautiful Euclid-like argument, but it is not short;
here we present a short proof which use gradient flow for Busemann's functions.

\begin{thm}{Corollary}\label{cor:splitting}
Let $\spc{L}\in\CBB{}0$. 
Then there is an isometric splitting
\[
\spc{L}=\spc{L}'\oplus H
\]
where $H\subset \spc{L}$ is a subset isometric to a Hilbert space and $\spc{L}'\subset \spc{L}$ be a convex subset which contains no lines. 
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Corollary}\label{cor:splitting-vectors}
Let $\spc{K}\in\CBB{}0$ be a cone and $v_+,v_-\in \spc{K}$ be a pair of opposite vectors 
(i.e., $v_+ + v_-=$).
Then there is an isometry $\iota\:K\to K'\times \RR$, where $K'\in\CBB{}0$ is a cone with vertex $o'$ such that
$\iota:v_\pm\mapsto (o',\pm|v_\pm|)$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Corollary}\label{cor:splitting-CBB[1]}
Assume $\spc{L}\in\CBB{m}1$, $m\ge2$ and $\rad\spc{L}=\pi$ then 
\[\spc{L}\iso \SS^m.\]
 
\end{thm}



\parit{Proof.} Consider two Busemann's functions $\bus_+$ and $\bus_-$ asociated with rays $\gamma:[0,\infty)\to \spc{L}$ and $\gamma:(-\infty,0]\to \spc{L}$, i.e.
\[
\bus_\pm(x)
=
\lim_{t\to\infty}\dist{\gamma(\pm t)}{x}{}- t.
\]
According to \ref{thm:busemann}, both functions $\bus_\pm$ are concave.

Fix $x\in \spc{L}$.
Note that since $\gamma$ is a line, we have 
\[\bus_+(x)+\bus_-(x)\ge0.\]
On the other hand, by \ref{comp-kappa} 
$f(t)=\dist[2]{x}{}{}\circ\gamma(t)$ 
is $2$-concave.
 
In particular, $f(t)\le t^2+at+b$ for some constants $a,b\in\RR$. 
Passing to the limit as $t\to\pm\infty$, we get \[\bus_+(x)+\bus_-(x)\le0.\]

Hence
\[
\bus_+(x)+\bus_-(x)= 0
\]
for any $x\in \spc{L}$.
It follows that for any $x$,
\[
|\nabla_x \bus_\pm|
=\sup\set{\d_x\bus_\pm(\xi)}{\xi\in\Sigma_x}
=\sup\set{-\d_x\bus_\mp(\xi)}{\xi\in\Sigma_x}\equiv1.
\] 
Therefore???, $1$-Lipschitz curve $\alpha$, such that $\bus_\pm(\alpha(t))=t+\Const$ is a $\bus_\pm$-gradient curve. 
In particular, $\alpha(t)$ is a $\bus_+$-gradient curve if and only if $\alpha(-t)$ is a $\bus_-$-gradient curve.
It follows that for any $t>0$, $\GF_{\bus_+}^t\circ\GF_{\bus_-}^t=\id_\spc{L}$.
Set
\[\GF^t=\left[\begin{matrix}
\GF_{\bus_+}^t&\hbox{if}\ t\ge0\\
\GF_{\bus_-}^t&\hbox{if}\ t<0
               \end{matrix}\right.\]
it defines an $\RR$-action on $\spc{L}$.

Set $\spc{L}'=\bus_+^{-1}(0)=\bus_-^{-1}(0)\subset \spc{L}$, it is a closed convex set, therefore it forms an Alexandrov's space.
Consider map $h\:\spc{L}'\times \RR\to \spc{L}$ defined by $h\:(x,t)\mapsto \GF^t(x)$.
It is easy to see that $h$ is onto.
Applying distance estimate \ref{thm:dist-est} for $\GF_{\bus_+}^t$ and $\GF_{\bus_-}^t$, we get that $h$ is a short and non-contracting at the same time; i.e. $h$ is an isometry.\qeds












\section{Soul theorem}

In Riemannian case, the following theorem was proved in \cite{cheeger-gromoll-soul}.
The last statement was proved in \cite{sharafutdinov}.

\begin{thm}{Soul theorem}
Let $\spc{L}\in\CBB{m}0$. 
Then there is a convex compact subset $S\subset \spc{L}$ (which is called \emph{soul}\index{soul} of $\spc{L}$), such that  $S\in\CBB{\kay}0$, $\kay\le m$,
$S$ has no boundary,
$S$ is a strict short deformational retuct of $\spc{L}$, i.e. there one parameter of short maps $h_t\:\spc{L}\to \spc{L}$ such that $h_0=\id$, $h_1(\spc{L})=S$, $h_t(s)=s$ for any $s\in S$ and $t\in[0,1]$.

More over, $S$ is uniquely defined up to isometry.
\end{thm}

If $\spc{L}$ is a Riemannian manifold then in fact
$\spc{L}$ is diffeomorphic to the total space of the normal bundle of $\iota(S)$ in $\spc{L}$. 
For Alexandrov spaces a similar strengthening is false as the following example shows:

\parbf{Example} Consider product space $\SS^2\times \EE^2$ equiped with isometric $\ZZ_2$-action, which acts by cental simmetry on each $\SS^2$ and $\EE^2$; thus it has exactly two fixed points $v$ and $w$ on $\SS^2\times 0$.

According to ???,
the factor-space $\spc{L}=\SS^2\times \EE^2/\ZZ_2$ is a $4$-dimensional Alexandrov space with curvature $\ge 0$.
It has exactly two singular points, the orbits of $v$ and $w$, a neigborhood at each is homeomorphic to $\Cone\RP^3$.
The image of $\SS^2\times 0$ in $\spc{L}$ is homeomorphic to $\SS^2$ and it forms an Alexandrov space without boundary.

Thus, the soul of $\spc{L}$ is homeomorphic to $\SS^2$. 
Since $\spc{L}$ has exactly two topological singularities it can not be presented as a fiber bunndle over $\SS^2$. 

\smallskip

The proof of is based on ???,
the rest of the proof repeats the proof of classical soul theorem \cite{cheeger-gromoll-soul} and \cite{sharafutdinov}.

\parit{Proof.}???

\section{Shioya's splitting}

For Riemannian case, corollary \ref{cor:shioya} was proved in \cite{mendonca:shioya}, it was conjectured in \cite{shioya} where a weaker statement had been proved.
The followng more general theorem was obtained in \cite{perelman:collapsing} independently.

Given $\spc{L}\in\CBB m0$ and $p\in \spc{L}$, set\index{$\T_\infty$} $(\T_\infty,0)=\GHlim_{\eps\to0} \eps\blow(\spc{L},p)$.
Clearly $\T_\infty$ does not depends on the choice of $p$.
From ??? it is clear that $\T_\infty \spc{L}\in \CBB \kay 0$ for $\kay\le m$.
The space $\T_\infty \spc{L}$ is called \emph{cone at infinity}\index{cone at infinity}, it has natural cone structure WHy???.
Thus, there is space $\Sigma_\infty \spc{L}\in \CBB {\kay-1} 1$\index{$\Sigma_\infty$} such that $\T_\infty \spc{L}\iso\Cone\Sigma_\infty \spc{L}$.
The space $\Sigma_\infty \spc{L}$ is called \emph{ideal boundary}\index{ideal boundary} of $\spc{L}$.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:shioya} 
Let $\spc{L}\in\CBB m0$ 
and $\dim\T_\infty=\kay$. 
Assume $\T_\infty$ has no extremal subsets then $\spc{L}$ can be isometrically splitted into product
\[\spc{L}=K\oplus \spc{L}'\]
where $K,\spc{L}'\subset \spc{L}$ are closed convex subsets, $\dim \spc{L}'=\kay$ and $K$ is copmact.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Corollary}\label{cor:shioya}
Let $\spc{L}\in\CBB m0$ 
and $\dim\Sigma_\infty \spc{L}=\kay-1$. 
Assume $\rad\Sigma_\infty \spc{L}>\tfrac\pi2$, then 
$\spc{L}$ can be isometrically splitted into product
\[\spc{L}=K\oplus \spc{L}'\]
where $K,\spc{L}'\subset \spc{L}$ are closed convex subsets, $\dim \spc{L}'=\kay$ and $K$ is copmact.
\end{thm}

Note that if $\rad\Sigma_\infty \spc{L}=\tfrac\pi2$, the conclusion of the corollary does not hold even in Riemannian category.
In fact by taking a product of flat open M\"obius band with $\RR$ we have a counterexample.



\section{Erd\H{o}s' problem rediscovered}

The following theorem was proved in ???.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:extr-point}
Let $\spc{L}\in\CBB{m}0$.
Then it has at most $2^m$ one-point extremal sets.
\end{thm}


The proof is a translation of proof of classical problem in combinatoric geometry to Alexandrov's language.

\begin{thm}{Erd\H{o}s' problem}
Let $F$ be a set of points in $\EE^m$ such that any triangle formed by three distinct points in $F$ has no obtuse angles.
Then number of elements in $F$ can not exeed $2^m$.

Moreover, if $|F|=2^m$ then $F$ consists of vertexes of right paralelepiped.
\end{thm}

This problem was posted in \cite{erdos} and solved in \cite{danzer-gruenbaum}.
The question of classifing all $\spc{L}$ with the maximal number one-point extremal sets turns out to be more delicate see \cite{lebedeva}.
Let us describe a class of examples.
Let $\TT^m$ be standart torus 
and $\Gamma$ be a subgroup generated by all coordinte reflections.
Clearly, $\Gamma$ is isomorphic to $\ZZ_2^m$ and it has exactly $2^m$ fixed points in $\TT^m$.
Let $\Gamma'\subset\Gamma$ be a subgroup which has the same fixed point set as $\Gamma$ 
and $g$ be a flat $\Gamma'$-ivariant metric on $\TT^m$.
Then, $(\TT^m,g)/\Gamma'\in\CBB m0$ and it has exactly $2^m$ one-point extremal subsets; it follows from ??? and ???.
The above construction does not describes all $\CBB m0$-spaces with $2^m$ one-point extremal subsets, but it is close to the correct answer.

The finding resonable estimates for maximal number of extraml one-point subsets in a $\CBB m 1$-space is completely open;
it analogous to the follolwing problem: finding maximal number $n(m)$ such that there are points $p_1,p_2,\dots p_n$ in $\EE^m$ such that any triangle $\trig{p_i}{p_j}{p_\kay}$ is acute.
It is expected $n(m)\ll 2^m$, but so far it is only known that 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $n(m)\ge 2m$ --- the configuration s slight perturbation of vertexes of $m$-octahedra.
\item $n(m)\le ???$
\end{enumerate}


\parit{Proof of \ref{thm:extr-point}.}
Let $\{p_i\}$, $i\in\{1,2,\dots,N\}$ be the one-point extreaml sets.
For each $p_i$ consider its open Voronoi domain $V_i$; i.e. 
\[V_i=\set{x\in \spc{L}}{\dist{p_i}{x}{}<\dist{p_j}{x}{}\ \t{for any}\ j\not=i}.\]
Clearly $V_i\cap V_j=\emptyset$ if $i\not=j$.
Note that $\vol_mV_i>\frac{1}{2^m}\vol_m \spc{L}$.

Indeed, fix $i$ and for given $\alpha\in(0,1)$, consider $\alpha$-homothety $\map_\alpha\:\spc{L}\to \spc{L}$ with center at $p_i$; 
i.e. for each point $x\in \spc{L}$ choose a geodesic $[p_ix]$ and set
$\map_\alpha x=\geod_{[p_ix]}(\alpha\dist{p_i}{x}{})$.
From comparison we have that $\vol(\map_\alpha \spc{L})\ge\alpha^m\vol \spc{L}$.
For any $x\in \spc{L}$ and all $\alpha<\tfrac{1}{2}$ we have $\map_\alpha x\in V_i$.
Assume $x'=\map_\alpha x\notin V_i$,
then threre is $p_j$ such that $\dist{p_i}{x'}{}\ge\dist{p_j}{x'}{}$.
Then from comparison, we have $\angk0{p_j}{p_i}{x}>\tfrac\pi2$;
i.e. $p_j$ does not form a one-point extremal set.???

\section{Remarks and open questions}

In \cite{perelman-soul}, it was proved that if $\spc{L}$ is non-negatively curved Riemannian manifold 
and $S\subset \spc{L}$ is its soul 
then Sharafundinov's returction $\Shar\:\spc{L}\to S$ is a submetry;
i.e. for any $x\in \spc{L}$ and $y\in S$ there is $y'\in \Shar^{-1}(y)$ such that  $\dist{\Shar(x)}{y}{}=\dist{x}{y'}{}$. 

This statement is likely remains true for non-negatively curved Alexandrov space, 
but the proof can not be generalized directly.
