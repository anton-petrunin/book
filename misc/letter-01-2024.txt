Dear Jennifer

After your changes the math formulas look strange;
sometimes it is hard to read, and sometimes it is impossible to read.
It seems that you redefine our macros (\Im, \varpi, \subto, and so on) and changed fonts.
Could you revert these changes, we want the formulas to be exactly the same as in our original file.

This is the main problem, after that we could do other thing.

By the way, you did not change the formulas in the pictures.
We checked several earlier books in GSM and they use standard math fonts (we want the same fonts).

Also, what type of issue did you have with crossrefs? 
Another thing: despite you stating otherwise, you did not implement
our mathematical hyphenation, but now it is a minor issue;
let us discuss it after you done with formulas.

Thank you, Anton & Vitya
