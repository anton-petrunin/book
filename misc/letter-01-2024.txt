Dear Jennifer

The main problem is that you changed the math fonts and our notations in the book.
Now it is hard to read, and sometimes impossible to read.

So before we start, could you revert these changes?
By the way, you did not change the formulas in the pictures.
We checked earlier books (33 and 48 in GSM) and they use standard math fonts.

(Also, what type of issue did you have with crossrefs? 
Another thing: despite you stating otherwise, you did not implement our mathematical hyphenation, but now it is a minor issue.)

Thank you, Anton & Vitya
