Dear Jennifer,
Before we address your typesetting  comments we would like to resolve the following issue.


You have changed many of our math fonts and formulas. Now many formulas
are hard to read, and sometimes are impossible to read.
Some notations after your changes are wrong such as the notation for subfunction (first occurring on page 19) and for an interval (first occurring on page 7), the notation for model diameter (first occurring on page 3)

It seems that you have redefined all our macros (\Im, \varpi, \subto, and so on) and that resulted in changed fonts and wrong formulas.
We would like these changes to be reverted, we want the formulas to be exactly as they are in our original file.

This is the main problem we would like addressed first before we discuss minor typos and corrections.

By the way, you did not change the formulas in the pictures so they now look different from fonts in the text.
We checked several earlier books in GSM and they use standard math fonts. We would like to do the same.

Also, what type of issue did you have with crossrefs? 

%??? V: what do you mean?

Another thing: we were promised that our mathematical hyphenation  would be kept but that was changed too.
This is however a minor issue and we would like to see the issues with math fonts and formulas addressed first.


Thank you, 
Anton & Vitya
