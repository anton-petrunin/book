We thank the referee for this report.
Here are some comments, numbered as in the  report.

3a. 
We reordered Chapters 3, 4 and 5 to reduce forward referencing.

3b
We removed the "very limited" statement.

3c
The description of our series says "carefully written as teaching aids ... often used as textbooks".  Our book is not meant as a textbook but as a teaching and reference aid for a course or self-study.
It is not meant for reading straight through.

3d
Our index includes notations.
The funny omega is actually \varpi, a variant of \pi.
According to the index, it is defined on page 3 (and it is there).
Bared k is removed. Thank you.

12 
We added a clarifying remark on the Hsiang--Kleiner work.
We mention Grove--Wilking for the exceptionally interesting proof (it is not about the result).

15. 
Most of the time we use (first-name)+(last-name) for every reference.
We use last names in the names of theorems like Grove--Petersen comparison, and sometimes when names reappear in the same context (Alexandrov and Gromov often come without their first names).
It seems to be consistent usage. 

We eliminated the footnotes.

We use "w-limit" when a choice of w is implicit, and "ultralimit" when  discussing ultralimits in general.

The word "strut" has the suggestive meaning "framework that resists compression".
The word "strainer" in English is unrelated to this context.
