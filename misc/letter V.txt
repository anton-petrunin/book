We would like to thank the referees for their report and the suggestions on improving the book.

We would now like to address the specific comments and suggestions by the referee, numbered as in the report.



3a. 
However eliminated some but not all forward referencing in the book.
Having some forward referencing was a deliberate decision during the writing of the book. This was done to make the presentation more natural. Most people reading the book will have some familiarity with the subject and will not find forward referencing that we do have
too distracting. Also, whenever we do use it we provide explicit references to the places in the book where relevant material is introduced. This is not something we are willing to change. We did reorder Chapters 3, 4, 5 to reduce forward referencing in early chapters. This in particular addresses
referee's complain about the use of sub function notation before it was introduced.

3b
We removed the "very limited" remark about our use of ultralimits but otherwise we left the ultralimits chapter as is. We think we provide enough justification for their use

3c
The description of our series says "carefully written as teaching aids ... often used as textbooks".  Our book is not meant as a textbook but as a teaching and reference aid for a course or self-study.
It is not meant for reading straight through.

3d
Our index includes notations.
The funny omega is actually \varpi, a variant of \pi.
According to the index, it is defined on page 3 (and it is there).
Bared k is removed. Thank you.

We added a clarifying remark on the Hsiang--Kleiner work.
We mention Grove--Wilking for the exceptionally interesting proof (it is not about the result).

15. 
Most of the time we use (first-name)+(last-name) for every reference.
We use last names in the names of theorems like Grove--Petersen comparison, and sometimes when names reappear in the same context (Alexandrov and Gromov often come without their first names).
It seems to be consistent usage. 

We eliminated the footnotes.

We use "w-limit" when a choice of w is implicit, and "ultralimit" when  discussing ultralimits in general.

The word "strut" has the suggestive meaning "framework that resists compression".
The word "strainer" in English is unrelated to this context.
