\parbf{Exercise~\ref{exr-crofton}.}
Suppose $\alpha$ is a closed spherical curve. 
By Crofton's formula length of curve $\alpha$ on the sphere equals to $\pi\cdot n_\alpha$, where $n_\alpha$ denotes the average number of crossings of $\alpha$ with equators.

Since $\alpha$ is closed, almost all equators cross it at even number of points (we assume that $\infty$ is an even number.
If $\length \alpha<2\cdot\pi$ then $n_\alpha<2$.
Therefore there is an equator that does not cross $\alpha$ --- hence the result.


\parbf{Exercise~\ref{ex:complete=>complete};}
\textit{(\ref{SHORT.ex:complete=>complete:complete}).}
Note that any Cauchy sequence $(x_n)$ in $(\spc{X},\yetdist{}{}{})$ is also Cauchy in $\spc{X}$.
Since $\spc{X}$ is complete, $x_n$ converges; denote its limit by $x_\infty$.

Passing to a subsequence, we may assume that $\yetdist{x_{n-1}}{x_n}{}<\tfrac1{2^n}$.
It follows that there is a 1-Lipschitz curve $\alpha\:[0,1]\to (\spc{X},\yetdist{}{}{})$ such that $x_n=\alpha(\tfrac1{2^n})$ and $x_\infty=\alpha(0)$.
In particular $\yetdist{x_n}{x_\infty}{}\to0$ and $n\to\infty$.

\parit{(\ref{SHORT.ex:complete=>complete:compact}).}
Fix two points $x,y\in\spc{X}$ such that $\ell=\yetdist{x}{y}{}<\infty$.
Let $\alpha_n$ be a sequence of paths from $x$ to $y$ such that $\length(\alpha_n)\to\ell$ as $n\to \infty$.
Without loss of generality we may assume that each $\alpha_n$ is $(\ell+1)$-Lipschitz.

Since $\spc{X}$ is compact, there is a partial limit of $\alpha_n$ as $n\to \infty$,
denote it by $\alpha_\infty$.
By semicontinuity of length, $\length\alpha_\infty\le\ell$;
that is $\alpha$ is a shortest path in $\spc{X}$.

\parbf{Exercise~\ref{ex:no-geod}.}
The following example is suggested by Fedor Nazarov \cite{nazarov}.

\medskip

Consider the unit ball $(B,\rho_0)$
in the space $c_0$ of all sequences converging to zero equipped with the sup-norm.

Consider another metric $\rho_1$ which is different from $\rho_0$ by the conformal factor
\[\phi(\bm{x})=2+\tfrac{1}2\cdot x_1+\tfrac{1}4\cdot x_2+\tfrac{1}8\cdot x_3+\dots,\]
where $\bm{x}=(x_1,x_2\,\dots)\in B$.
That is, if $\bm{x}(t)$, $t\in[0,\ell]$, is a curve parametrized by $\rho_0$-length 
then its $\rho_1$-length is 
\[\length_{\rho_1}\bm{x}=\int\limits_0^\ell\phi\circ\bm{x}.\]
Note that the metric $\rho_1$ is bi-Lipschitz to~$\rho_0$.

Assume $\bm{x}(t)$ and $\bm{x}'(t)$ are two curves parametrized by $\rho_0$-length that differ only in the $m$-th coordinate, denoted by $x_m(t)$ and $x_m'(t)$ correspondingly.
Note that if $x'_m(t)\le x_m(t)$ for any $t$ and 
the function $x'_m(t)$ is locally $1$-Lipschitz at all $t$ such that $x'_m(t)< x_m(t)$, then 
\[\length_{\rho_1}\bm{x}'\le \length_{\rho_1}\bm{x}.\]
Moreover this inequality is strict if $x'_m(t)< x_m(t)$ for some~$t$.

Fix a curve $\bm{x}(t)$, $t\in[0,\ell]$, parametrized by  $\rho_0$-length.
We can choose $m$ large, so that $x_m(t)$ is sufficiently close to $0$ for any~$t$.
In particular, for some values $t$, we have $y_m(t)<x_m(t)$, where
\[y_m(t)=(1-\tfrac t\ell)\cdot x_m(0)
+\tfrac t\ell\cdot x_m(\ell)
-\tfrac 1{100}\cdot \min\{t,\ell-t\}.\]
Consider the curve $\bm{x}'(t)$ as above with
\[x'_m(t)=\min\{x_m(t),y_m(t)\}.\]
Note that $\bm{x}'(t)$ and $\bm{x}(t)$ have the same end points, and by the above
\[\length_{\rho_1}\bm{x}'<\length_{\rho_1}\bm{x}.\]
That is, for any curve $\bm{x}(t)$ in $(B,\rho_1)$, we can find a shorter curve $\bm{x}'(t)$ with the same end points.
In particular, $(B,\rho_1)$ has no geodesics.

\parbf{Exercise~\ref{exercise from BH}.}
The following example is taken from~\cite{BH}.

Consider the following subset of $\R^2$ equipped with the induced length metric
\[
\spc{X}
=
\bigl((0,1]\times\{0,1\}\bigr)
\cup
\bigl(\{1,\tfrac12,\tfrac13,\dots\}\times[0,1]\bigr)
\]
Note that $\spc{X}$ is locally compact and geodesic.

Its completion $\bar{\spc{X}}$ is isometric to the closure of $\spc{X}$ equipped with the induced length metric;
$\bar{\spc{X}}$ is obtained from $\spc{X}$ by adding two points $p=(0,0)$ and $q=(0,1)$.

The point $p$ admits no compact neighborhood in $\bar{\spc{X}}$ 
and there is no geodesic connecting $p$ to $q$ in~$\bar{\spc{X}}$. \qeds 

\parbf{Exercise~\ref{ex:compact-in-lenght}}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a compact metric space.
Let us identify $\spc{X}$ with its image under Kuratowsky embedding.
Denote by $\spc{K}$ the \emph{linear} convex hull of $\spc{X}$ is the space of bounded functions on $\spc{X}$;
that is $x\in \spc{K}$ if and only if $x$ can not be separated from $\spc{X}$ by a hyperplane.

Since $\spc{X}$ is compact, so is $\spc{K}$.
It remains to observe that $\spc{K}$ is a length space.

\parbf{Exercise~\ref{ex:nonconvex-limit}.} Let $\spc{X}_n$ be the plane with the metric induced by $\ell^n$-norm and $f_n(x,y)=x$ for all $n$.
Observe that $\spc{X}_\o$ is the plane with the metric induced by $\ell^\infty$-norm where the limit function $f_\o(x,y)=x$ is not convex.

\parbf{Exercise~\ref{ex:adjacent-angles}.}
If $\mangle\hinge pxz+\mangle\hinge pyz< \pi$, then by the triangle inequality for angles (\ref{claim:angle-3angle-inq}) we have $\mangle\hinge pxy< \pi$.
The latter implies that a short $[xy]$ fails to be a geodesic around $p$.

\parbf{Exercise~\ref{ex:tangent-vect=o(t)}.}
By the definition of right derivative, there is a gedesic $\gamma$ such that both limits 
\[\limsup_{\eps\to0+}\frac{\dist{\alpha(\eps)}{\gamma(\eps)}{\spc{X}}}{\eps}
\quad\text{and}\quad
\limsup_{\eps\to0+}\frac{\dist{\beta(\eps)}{\gamma(\eps)}{\spc{X}}}{\eps}\]
are arbitrarily small.
Therefore 
\[\limsup_{\eps\to0+}\frac{\dist{\alpha(\eps)}{\beta(\eps)}{\spc{X}}}{\eps}=0.\]

\parbf{Exercise~\ref{ex:both-sided-diff}.}
Follows directly from the definition of right and left derivatives.

\parbf{Exercise~\ref{ex:schroeder-foetch}.}
Choose two non-Euclidean norms $|{*}|_{\spc{X}}$ and $|{*}|_{\spc{Y}}$ on $\RR^{10}$ such that the sum $|{*}|_{\spc{X}}+|{*}|_{\spc{Y}}$ is Euclidean.

Assume $\dist{p}{x^i}{}=\dist{q}{y^i}{}$ for each $i$.
Observe and use that
\[\dist{x^i}{x^j}{}\le\dist{y^i}{y^j}{}

\parbf{Exercise~\ref{ex:G-delta-not-thru}.}
Any nonnegatively curved metric on the plane with everywhere dense set of singular points will do the job;
by singular point we understand a point with total angle around it strictly smaller than $2\cdot\pi$.

Indeed, if $x_i$ is a singular point then there is $\eps_i>0$ such that no geodesic with ends outside of $\oBall(x_i,r)$ can meet the ball $\oBall(x_i,\eps_i\cdot r)$.
The set 
\[\Omega_n=\bigcup_i \oBall(x_i,\tfrac{\eps_i}n)\]
is open and everywhere dense.
Note that $\Omega_n$ may intersect a geodesic only at $\tfrac1n$-end of it.
The intersection of $\Omega_n$ is a G-delta dense set that does not intersect interior of any geodesic.

\parbf{Exercise~\ref{ex:fat-triangle}.} Apply angle-sidelength  monotonicity (\ref{cor:monoton}) twice. 

\parbf{Exercise~\ref{ex:busemann}.} The first part follows from angle-sidelength  monotonicity (\ref{cor:monoton}).
An example for the second part can be found among metrics on $\RR^2$ induced by a norm. (Compare to Exercise~\ref{mink+alex=euclid}.)

\parbf{Exercises \ref{ex:busemann-CBB} and \ref{ex:busemann-CBA}.}
By the definition of Busemann function,
\begin{align*}
\exp(&\sqrt{-\kappa}\cdot\bus_\gamma) 
= \exp \left[\lim_{t\to \infty} \sqrt{-\kappa}\cdot(\distfun{{\gamma (t)}}{}{} - t)\right]=
\\
&= \lim_{t\to \infty} \biggl(\exp \left[\sqrt{-\kappa}\cdot(\distfun{\gamma (t)}{}{} -t)\right]
+\exp\left[\sqrt{-\kappa}\cdot(-d_{\gamma (t)}-t)\right]\biggr)=
\\
&=  \lim_{t\to \infty} \left(2\cdot \cosh \left[\sqrt{-\kappa}\cdot\distfun{\gamma (t)}{}{}\right]\cdot \exp\left[\sqrt{-\kappa}\cdot(-t)\right]\right).
\end{align*}

By the function comparison definitions of $\CAT\kappa$ space (\ref{function-comp}) or $\Alex{\kappa}$ space (\ref{comp-kappa}),  for any $p\in \spc{U}$ the function\\ $f=\cosh \sqrt{-\kappa}\circ\distfun{p}{}{}$ satisfies $f''+\kappa \cdot f\ge 0$ (respectively  $f''+\kappa \cdot f\le 0$). The result follows.

\parbf{Exercise~\ref{ex:noncomplete-globalization}.} Read \cite{petrunin:globalization}.

\parbf{Exercise~\ref{ex:fixed-point}.} If $\diam(\spc{L}/G)>\tfrac\pi2$, then for some $x\in \spc{L}$ we have
\[\sup \set{\distfun{G\cdot x}(y)}{y\in \spc{L}}
>
\tfrac\pi2.\]
Use comparison to show that there is unique point $y^{*}$ that lies on the maximal distance from the orbit $G\cdot x$.
Observe that $y^{*}$ is a fixed point.

\parbf{Exercise~\ref{ex:kleiner}.}
This exercise is based on the main idea in \cite{hsiang-kleiner}.

\medskip

Assume there are 4 such points $x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4$
Note that from comparison the average of $\mangle\hinge{x_i}{x_j}{x_k}$ is at larger than $\tfrac\pi3$.
On the other hand, since each $x_i$ has spaces of directions $\le\tfrac12\cdot\mathbb{S}^n$, the average of $\mangle\hinge{x_i}{x_j}{x_k}$ is at most $\tfrac\pi3$ --- a contradiction.


\parbf{Exercise~\ref{ex:ccat-(3+1)}.}

\parbf{Exercise~\ref{ex:sba-2+2-short}.}

\parbf{Exercise~\ref{ex:CAT-mnfld=>ext.geod}.}
Suppose that a geodesic $[px]$ is not expendable behind $x$.
We may assume that $\dist{p}{x}{}<\varpi\kappa$;
otherwise move $p$ along the geodesic toward to $x$.

By the uniqueness of geodesics (\ref{thm:cat-unique}), any point $y$ in a neighborhood $\Omega\ni x$ is connected to $p$ by a unique geodesic path, denote it by $\gamma_y$.
Moreover, $h_t(y)=\gamma_y(t)$ defines a homotopy between the identity map of $\Omega$ and the constant map with value $p$;
this is the  so called \index{geodesic homotopy}\emph{geodesic homotopy}.

Since $[px]$ is not extendable, $x\notin h_t(\Omega)$ for any $t<1$.
In particular the local homology groups vanish at $x$ --- a contradiction.

\parbf{Exercise~\ref{ex:complete-space-of-dir}.} Choose a sequence of geodesic directions $\xi_n$ at $p$; denote by $\gamma_n$ the corresponding geodesics.
Since the space $\spc{U}$ is locally compact, we may pass a converging subsequence of $(\gamma_n)$; denote its limit by limit $\gamma_\infty$ and its direction by $\xi_\infty$.
By comparison, $\xi_\infty$ is a limit of $(\xi_n)$.

\parbf{Exercise~\ref{ex:convexity-CAT0}.} %???+PIC
It sufficient to show that if $v$ and $y$ are midpoints of geodesics $[uw]$ and $[xz]$ in $\spc{U}$, then
\[\dist{v}{y}{}\le \tfrac12\cdot(\dist{u}{x}{}+\dist{w}{z}{}).\]

Denote by $p$ the midpoint of $[uz]$.
Applying angle-sidelength  monotonicity (\ref{cor:monoton-cba}) twice, we get
\[\dist{v}{p}{}\le \tfrac12\cdot\dist{w}{z}{}.\]
The same way we obtain 
\[\dist{y}{p}{}\le \tfrac12\cdot\dist{u}{x}{}.\]
It remains to add these two inequalities and apply the triangle inequality.

(This inequality also follows directly from the majorization theorem (\ref{thm:major}).)

\parbf{Exercise~\ref{ex:equality-for-thin}.}

\parbf{Exercise~\ref{ex:busemann-CBA}.}
See the solution of Exercises~\ref{ex:busemann-CBB}.

\parbf{Exercise~\ref{ex:closest-point-projection}.}

\parbf{Exercise~\ref{ex:short-retraction-CBA(1)}.}
Without loss of generality, we may assume that $p\in K$.

If $\dist{K}{x}{}\ge\pi$, then set $\map[2](x)=p$.

Otherwise, if $\dist{K}{x}{}<\pi$, by Closest-point projection lemma~\ref{lem:closest point}, 
there is unique point $x^*\in K$ that minimizes distance to $x$;
that is, $\dist{x^*}{x}{}=\dist{K}{x}{}$.
Let us define $\ell_x$, $\phi_x$ and $\psi_x$ using the floowing identities:
\begin{align*}
\ell_x&=\dist{p}{x^*}{},
\\
\phi_x&=\tfrac\pi2-\dist[{{}}]{x^*}{x}{},
\\
\sin\psi_x&=\sin\phi_x\cdot\sin\ell_x, 
\ \ 0\le \psi_x\le \tfrac\pi2.
\intertext{Set}
\map[2](x)&=\geod_{[px^*]}(\psi_x).
\end{align*}

Note that $\map[2]$ is a retraction to $K$; 
that is,
$\map[2](x)\in K$ for any $x\in \spc{U}$
and 
$\map[2](a)=a$ for any $a\in K$.

Let us show that $\map[2]$ is short.
Given $x,y\in\oBall(K,\tfrac\pi2)$, set
\begin{align*}
x'&=\map[2](x)
&
y'&=\map[2](y)
\\
r&=\dist{x}{y}{}
&
r'&=\dist{x'}{y'}{}
\\
d&=\dist{x^*}{y^*}{}
&
\alpha&=\angk1{p}{x^*}{y^*}
\end{align*}

Note that 
\[\cos r\le 
\cos\phi_x\cdot\cos\phi_y
-
\cos d\cdot\sin\phi_x\cdot\sin\phi_y.\eqlbl{eq:cos(r)}\]

Indeed, if $x,y\notin K$,
then 
$\mangle\hinge{x^*}{x}{y*}, 
\mangle\hinge{y^*}{y}{x*}
\ge 
\tfrac\pi2$
and
the inequality~\ref{eq:cos(r)} follows from the Arm lemma (\ref{lem:arm}).
If $x\in K$ and $y\notin K$, we get \ref{eq:cos(r)}, by angle comparison (\ref{cat-hinge}) 
since $\mangle\hinge{y^*}{y}{x*}\ge \tfrac\pi2$.
The same way \ref{eq:cos(r)} is proved 
in case $x\notin K$ and $y\in K$.
Finally, if $x,y\in K$, $\phi_x=\phi_y=\tfrac\pi2$ and $r=d$;
that is, the inequality trivially holds.

Further note that
\[\cos\alpha
=
\frac{\cos d-\cos \ell_x\cdot\cos\ell_y}{\sin\ell_x\cdot\sin\ell_y}.\]
Applying angle-sidelength  monotonicity (\ref{cor:monoton-cba}) we get
\begin{align*}
\cos r'&\ge
\cos\psi_x\cdot\cos\psi_y
-
\cos \alpha \cdot\sin\psi_x\cdot\sin\psi_y=
\\
&=
\cos\psi_x\cdot\cos\psi_y
-(\cos d-\cos \ell_x\cdot\cos\ell_y)\cdot\sin\phi_x\cdot\sin\phi_y\ge
\\
&\ge \cos\psi_x\cdot\cos\psi_y
-\cos d\cdot\sin\phi_x\cdot\sin\phi_y
\end{align*}


Note that 
$\psi_x\le \phi_x$
and
$\psi_y\le \phi_y$;
in particular,
\[
\cos\phi_x\cdot\cos\phi_y\le \cos\psi_x\cdot\cos\psi_y.
\]
Hence 
\[\cos r'\ge \cos r;\]
that is, the restriction $\map[2]|\oBall(K,\tfrac\pi2)$ is short.
Clearly $\map[2]$ is continuous,
since the complement of $\oBall(K,\tfrac\pi2)$ is mapped to $p$,
we get that $\map[2]$ is short; that is,
\[r'\le r \eqlbl{eq:cos=<cos}\]
for any $x,y\in\spc{U}$.

If we have equality in \ref{eq:cos=<cos}
then 
\[\cos\ell_x\cdot\cos\ell_y\cdot\sin\phi_x\cdot\sin\phi_y=0.\]
If $K\subset \oBall(p,\tfrac\pi2)$, then $\ell_x,\ell_y<\tfrac\pi2$;
which implies that $x\in K$ or $y\in K$.
Without loss of generality we may assume that $x\in K$.

It remains to show that if $y\notin K$ 
then the inequality~\ref{eq:cos=<cos}
is strict.
If $\dist{K}{y}{}\ge\tfrac\pi2$, then \ref{eq:cos=<cos} holds since 
the left hand side is $<\tfrac\pi2$,
while right hand side is $\ge \tfrac\pi2$.
If $\dist{K}{y}{}<\tfrac\pi2$, then $\phi_y>0$ and clearly $\psi_y<\phi_y$,
hence the inequality~\ref{eq:cos=<cos} is strict.

We fail to find a transparent geometric proof of the statement above.
Below you will find a geometric way to think about the construction;

in the proof of Kirszbraun's theorem (\ref{thm:kirsz+}).
%%%UP

\parit{Geometric interpretation of the map $\map[2]$.}
Set $\mathring{\spc{U}}=\Cone \spc{U}$;
denote by $\mathring{K}$ the subcone of $\mathring{\spc{U}}$ spanned by $K$.
The space $\spc{U}$ can be naturally identified with the unit sphere in $\mathring{\spc{U}}$;
that is, the set 
\[\set{z\in \mathring{\spc{U}}}{|z|=1}.\]

According to \ref{thm:warp-curv-bound:cat}, $\mathring{\spc{U}}$ is $\CAT0$.
Note that $\mathring{K}$ forms a convex closed subset of $\mathring{\spc{U}}$.
According to \ref{lem:closest point}, for any point $x$ there is unique point $\hat x\in \mathring{K}$
that minimize the distance to $x$;
that is, $\dist{\hat x}{x}{}=\dist{K}{x}{}$.
(If $|\hat x|\ne0$, then in the notations above we have
$x^*=\tfrac1{|\hat x|}\cdot\hat x$.)

Consider the ray $t\mapsto t\cdot p$ in  $\mathring{\spc{U}}$.
According to ???, %ASK Stephanie???
for given $s\in \mathring{\spc{U}}$
the geodesics $\geod_{[s\ t\cdot p]}$ converge as $t\to\infty$ to a ray, 
say $\alpha_s\:[0,\infty)\to \mathring{\spc{U}}$.



Note that if $|x|=1$, then $|\hat x|\le 1$.
By assumption for any $a\in K$ the function $t\mapsto |\alpha_a(t)|$ is monotonicity increasing.
Therefore there is unique value $t_x\ge 0$ such that
$|\alpha_{\hat x}(t_x)|=1$.
Consider the map $\map[2]\:\spc{U}\to K$
defined as 
\[\map[2](x)=\alpha_{\hat x}(t_x).\]

\parbf{Exercise~\ref{ex:two-rays}.}
Consider the angle $A$ in the plane of measure $\pi-\alpha$.
Note that $A$ is $\CAT0$.
Therefore by Reshetnyak gluing theorem \ref{thm:gluing},
by gluing a side of $A$ to $\gamma_1$ in $\spc{U}$ we obtain a $\CAT0$ space, say $\spc{U}'$.

Note that $\gamma_2$ together with the other side of $A$ forms a both sides infinite geodesic, say $\gamma$ in $\spc{U}'$.
In particular, $\gamma$ is a convex set isometric to $\RR$.

Glue a half-plane along its boundary to $\gamma$.
By Reshetnyak gluing theorem \ref{thm:gluing} the obtained space is $\CAT0$.

It remains to note that this space can be obtained directly by gluing $\spc{U}$ to with $Q$ along $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$.

\parbf{Exercise~\ref{ex:glue-spherical-suspension}.}
Since $K$ is $\pi$-convex, it is $\CAT1$.
By \ref{thm:warp-curv-bound:cat}, the spherical suspension $\Susp K$ is $\CAT1$ as well.
Let us glue $\Susp K$ to $\spc{U}$ by along $K$;
according to Reshetnyak's gluing theorem, the obtained space, say $\spc{U}'$ is $\CAT1$.

Consider the geodesic path $\gamma\:[0,1]$ from $p$ to a pole of the suspension in $\spc{U}'$.
Set $K_t=\spc{U}\cap\cBall[\gamma(t),\tfrac\pi2]$.
By \ref{cor:convex-balls}, $K_t$ is $\pi$-convex of any $t$ and monotonicity of the family should be evident.

\parit{Remark.}
Note that if one applies Shrafutdinov's construction to the family of convex sets provided by the exercise we get a short strong deformation retraction from $\cBall[p,\tfrac\pi2]$ to $K$;
that is, there is a family of maps $\phi_t\:\cBall[p,\tfrac\pi2]\to \cBall[p,\tfrac\pi2]$ such that 
the function $t\mapsto \dist{\phi_t(x)}{\phi_t(y)}{}$ is nonincreasing for any pair of points $x,y\in\cBall[p,\tfrac\pi2]$, $\phi_t(x)=x$ for any $x\in K$ and $\phi_1(\cBall[p,\tfrac\pi2])=K$. 
Moreover we can assume that there is a family of short maps $\phi_t(\cBall[p,\tfrac\pi2])= K_t$ and $\phi_t(x)=x$ for any $t$ and $x\in K_t$.
It leads to another solution of Exercise~\ref{ex:short-retraction-CBA(1)}.
