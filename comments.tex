\chapter{Remarks and open problems}

The main problem in Alexandrov's geometry is to find a way to vary Alexandrov's
space, or simply to find a nearby Alexandrov's space to a given Alexandrov's
space. 
Lack of such variation procedure makes it impossible to use Alexandrov's
geometry in the way it was designed to be used: 

For example, 
assume you want to prove the Hopf conjecture;
that is, you want to show that $\SS^2\times \SS^2$ does not carre a metric with positive sectional curvature. 
Assume it is wrong, then there is a 4-dimensional complete length $\Alex0$ space $\spc{L}\in\CBB{4}{1}$ which is homeomorphic to $\SS^2\times \SS^2$ and volume-maximizing.
(There is no reason to believe
that this metric $d$ is Riemannian, but from Gromov's compactness theorem such
Alexandrov's metric should exist.) 
Provided we have a procedure to vary metric on $\spc{L}$ while keeping its curvature $\ge 1$,
we could find some special properties of $\spc{L}$  and in ideal situation show that
$\spc{L}$ does not exist.

Unfortunately, at the moment, there is no variation procedure available (except for boring rescaling). 
Even the following question seems to be completely open:

\begin{thm}{Open problem}\label{open:varray}
Let
$m\ge 3$, 
$\kappa<\Kappa$ 
and $\spc{L}$ be compact $m$-dimensional length $\Alex\Kappa$ space.
Given $\eps>0$ construct an $m$-dimensional complete length $\Alex\kappa$ space $\spc{L}'$
such that $\GHdist(\spc{L},\spc{L}')<\eps$ 
and $\spc{L}'$ is not isometric to $\lam\blow\spc{L}$ for any $\lam>0$.
\end{thm}
