\chapter{Definitions of curvature bounded below%READY
}

In Section~\ref{sec:angle}, 
we will start with a global definition of Alexandrov spaces via (1+3)-point comparison.
In Section~\ref{sec:more-angles}, 
we give a number of equivalent angle comparison definitions. 
These definitions maek it easy to adapt the Euclidean intuition to the Alexandrov's world.
Later we  give a few equivalent global definitions 
via concavity of distance functions and development (Section~\ref{sec:func-comp-CBB}).

In Section~\ref{sec:loc}, 
we give local versions of each definition and prove the globalization theorem.

Further, we discuss some basic corollaries of the definition:
Section~\ref{sec:prop.geod}
contains first variation formula 
and non-splitting property of geodesics;
Section~\ref{sec:positive.bound}
discusses specific properties of spaces with positive curvature bound are given.

\section{(1+3)-point comparison} \label{sec:angle}

\begin{thm}{Definition}
\label{df:1+3}
A quadruple of points $p,x^1,x^2,x^3$ in a metric space satisfies 
\emph{(1+3)-point $\kappa$-comparison}%
\index{(1+3)-point $\kappa$-comparison} 
if 
\[\angk\kappa p{x^1}{x^2}
+\angk\kappa p{x^2}{x^3}
+\angk\kappa p{x^3}{x^1}\le 2\cdot\pi.\eqlbl{Yup-kappa}\]
or at least one of the model angles $\angk\kappa p{x^i}{x^j}$ is not defined.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Definition}
\label{df:cbb1+3}
A metric space $\spc{L}$ 
is $\Alex{\kappa}$ 
if any quadruple $p,x^1,x^2,x^3\in \spc{L}$ satisfies (1+3)-point comparison.

We say that $\spc{L}$ an Alexandrov space with curvature bounded below 
(briefly, $\spc{L}$ is a  $\Alex{}$ space) if  $\spc{L}$  is $\Alex{\kappa}$ for some $\kappa\in\RR$.
\end{thm}

\parbf{Remarks} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Alexandrov spaces with curvature bounded below usually will be denoted by $\spc{L}$, for $\spc{L}$ower curvature bound.
\item In the definition of spaces with curvature $\ge\kappa$, when $\kappa>0$ most authors assume in addition that $\diam \spc{L}\le \varpi\kappa$, or equivalently, that $\spc{L}$ is not isometric to one of the exceptional spaces, see \ref{diam-k>0}. We do not make this assumption. In particular, we consider the real line to have curvature $\ge 1$.
\item If $\kappa<\Kappa$, then any complete length $\Alex{\Kappa}$ space is $\Alex{\kappa}$.
However, in the case $\Kappa>0$ it is not at all trivial, and will be shown only in \ref{cor:CAT>k-sence}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:(3+1)-expanding}
Let $\spc{L}$ be a complete length space.
Show that $\spc{L}$ is $\Alex\kappa$
if for any quadrouple of points $p,x^1,x^2,x^3\in \spc{L}$ such that
\[\dist{p}{x^1}{},\dist{p}{x^2}{},\dist{p}{x^3}{}<\varpi\kappa\]
there is a quadrouple of points $q,y^1,y^2,y^3\in\Lob3\kappa$
such that 
\[\dist{p}{x^i}{}=\dist{q}{y^i}{} 
\ \ \text{and}\ \ \dist{x^i}{x^j}{}\le\dist{y^i}{y^j}{}\] 
for all $i$ and $j$.
\end{thm}

The exercise above is a partial case of (1+\textit{n})-point comparison (\ref{thm:pos-config}).

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Let $\spc{L}$ be a length space.
Show that $\spc{L}$ is $\Alex0$
if and only if 
\[
\area\modtrig0(xyz)
\le
\area\modtrig0(pxy)+\area\modtrig0(pyz)+\area\modtrig0(pzx)
\]
for any 4 distinct points $p,x,y,z\in\spc{L}$.
\end{thm}

The following exercise decribes the first known definition of spaces with curvature bounded below;
it was given by Abraham Wald in \cite{wald}. 

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Let $\spc{L}$ be a complete length space and $\kappa\le 0$.
Prove that $\spc{L}$ is $\Alex\kappa$ if and only if for any quadruple of points $p,q,r,s\in \spc{L}$ can be isometrically embedded into some $\Lob2{\Kappa}$ for some $\Kappa\ge\kappa$.

Is the same true for $\kappa>0$, what is the difference?
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{mink+alex=euclid} 
Let $\spc{L}$ be  $\RR^m$ with the metric defined by a norm).
Show that $\spc{L}$ be a complete length $\Alex{}$ space if and only if $\spc{L}\iso\EE^m$.
\end{thm}

It is straightforward to check the following claim (for definitions of $\o$-limit and $\o$-power, 
see Section~\ref{ultralimits}).

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prp:A^omega}
Let $\o$ be a selective ultrafilter on $\NN$, $(\spc{L}_n,\star_n)\to (\spc{L}_\o,\star_\o)$ 
and $\kappa_n\to\kappa_\o$ as $n\to\o$.
Assume that $\spc{L}_n$ is a complete length $\Alex{\kappa_n}$ space for each $n$.
Then $\spc{L}_\o$ is is a complete length $\Alex{\kappa_\o}$ space.

Moreover, for any complete metric space $\spc{L}$,
its ultrapower $\spc{L}^\o$ is $\Alex\kappa$ if and only if so is $\spc{L}$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:submetry-CBB}
Let $\spc{L}$ be a complete length $\Alex{\kappa}$ space and $\spc{M}$ be a metric space.
Assume there is a sumbetry $\sigma\:\spc{L}\to\spc{M}$.
Then $\spc{M}$ is $\Alex{\kappa}$.
\end{thm}

The theorem above together with Proposition~\ref{prop:submet/G}
imply the following.

\begin{thm}{Corollary}\label{thm:CBB/G}
Let $\spc{L}$ be a complete length $\Alex{\kappa}$ space and the group $G$ acts on $\spc{L}$ by isometries 
and it has closed orbits.
Then the quotient space $\spc{L}/G$ is $\Alex\kappa$. 
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof of \ref{thm:submetry-CBB}.}
Fix $\delta>0$ and a quadruple of points $p,x^1,x^2,x^3\in \spc{M}$.
Choose arbitrary $\hat p\in \spc{L}$ such that $\sigma(\hat{p})=p$.
Next $\sigma$ is submetry, we can choose the points $\hat{x}^1,\hat{x}^2,\hat{x}^3\in \spc{M}$.
such that $\sigma(\hat x_i)=x_i$ and
\[\dist{\hat{p}}{\hat{x}^i}{\spc{L}}
\lege
\dist{p}{x^i}{\spc{M}}\pm\delta\]
for all $i$.
Note that 
\[\dist{\hat{x}^i}{\hat{x}^j}{\spc{L}}
>
\dist{x^i}{x^j}{\spc{M}}-2\cdot\delta\]
for all $i$ and $j$.
Therefore given $\eps>0$, the value $\delta$ above can be chousen in such a way that the inequality
\[\angk\kappa {\hat{p}}{\hat{x}^1}{\hat{x}^2}
<
\angk\kappa p{x^1}{x^2}+\eps
\eqlbl{eq:angles-M-L}\]
holds for all $i$ and $j$.

By (1+3)-point comparison in $\spc{L}$,
we have
\[\angk\kappa {\hat{p}}{\hat{x}^1}{\hat{x}^2}
+\angk\kappa {\hat{p}}{\hat{x}^2}{\hat{x}^3}
+\angk\kappa {\hat{p}}{\hat{x}^3}{\hat{x}^1}
\le 
2\cdot\pi\]
assuming all the angles on the left hand side are defined.
Applying  \ref{eq:angles-M-L}, 
we get 
\[\angk\kappa p{x^1}{x^2}
+\angk\kappa p{x^2}{x^3}
+\angk\kappa p{x^3}{x^1}< 2\cdot\pi+3\cdot\eps.\]

Since $\eps>0$ is arbitrary we have 
\[\angk\kappa p{x^1}{x^2}
+\angk\kappa p{x^2}{x^3}
+\angk\kappa p{x^3}{x^1}\le 2\cdot\pi;\]
that is,
the (1+3)-point $\kappa$-comparison holds in $\spc{M}$.
It remains to apply Proposition~\ref{prop:submet-length}.

\section{Geodesics}

Recall that general complete length spaces might have no geodesics;
see Exercise~\ref{ex:no-geod}.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Construct a complete length $\Alex0$ space which is not geodesic.
\end{thm}

We are going to show that all $\Alex{}$ spaces are G-delta geodesic in the following sense.

\begin{thm}{Definition}\label{def:alm-geod}
A complete length space $\spc{X}$ is called \emph{G-delta geodesic}\index{geodesic!G-delta geodesic space}\index{G-delta geodesic space} 
if for any point $p\in \spc{X}$ there is a dense G-delta set $W_p\subset\spc{X}$ such that for any $q\in W_p$ there is a geodesic $[p q]$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Definition}\label{def:straight}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a metric space 
and $p\in \spc{X}$.
A point $q\in \spc{X}$ is called \emph{$p$-straight}\index{straight!$*$-straight point} (briefly, $q\in \Str(p)$\index{$\Str(p)$}) if
\[\limsup_{r\to q}\frac{\dist{p}{r}{}-\dist{p}{q}{}}{\dist{q}{r}{}}=1.\]

For an array of points $x^1,x^2,\dots,x^\kay$, 
we use the notation
\[\Str(x^1,x^2,\dots,x^\kay)=\bigcap_{i=1}^\kay\Str(x^i).\]
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:almost.geod}
Let $\spc{L}$ be a complete length $\Alex{}$ space and $p\in \spc{L}$.
Then the set $\Str(p)$ is a dense G-delta set, 
and for any $q\in \Str(p)$ there is a unique geodesic $[p q]$.

In particular, $\spc{L}$ is G-delta geodesic.
\end{thm}

The theorem above was proved by Plaut \cite[Th. 27]{plaut:survey}.
His proof requires the following lemma in metric geometry.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:straight}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a complete length space. 
Then for any $p\in \spc{X}$ the set of $\Str(p)\subset\spc{X}$ is a dense G-delta set.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Set 
\[\Omega_n
=
\set{q\in \spc{X}}{(1-\tfrac{1}{n})\cdot\dist[{{}}]{q}{r}{}<
\dist{p}{r}{}-\dist{p}{q}{}
<\tfrac{1}{n}\ \t{for some}\ r\in \spc{X}}.\]
Clearly $\Omega_n$ is open; 
let us show that it is dense in $\spc{X}$.
Assuming the contrary, there is a point $x\in \spc{X}$ such that $\oBall(x,\eps)\cap \Omega_n=\emptyset$ for some $\eps>0$.
Since $\spc{L}$ is a length space, 
for any $\delta>0$, there exists a point $y\in \spc{L}$ such that $\dist{x}{y}{}<\tfrac\eps2+\delta$ and $\dist{p}{y}{}<\dist{p}{x}{}-\tfrac\eps2+\delta$. 
For sufficiently small $\eps$ and $\delta$, 
it follows that $(1-\tfrac{1}{n})\cdot\dist[{{}}]{y}{x}{}
<
\dist{p}{x}{}-\dist{p}{y}{}<\tfrac{1}{n}$, 
that is, $y\in\Omega_n$, 
a contradiction.

Since $\Str(p)=\bigcap_{n\in \NN}\Omega_n$, the result follows.
\qeds


\parit{Proof of Theorem \ref{thm:almost.geod}.}
Let $\spc{L}$ be a complete length $\Alex{\kappa}$ space.
We show that if $q\in \Str(p)$, then there is a unique geodesic connecting $p$ and $q$.
Thus the theorem will follow from Lemma~\ref{lem:straight}.

Note that it is sufficient to show that for all sufficiently small
$t>0$ there is unique point $z$ such that 
\[t
=
\dist{q}{z}{}
=
\dist{p}{q}{}-\dist{p}{z}{}.
\eqlbl{eq:thm:connect-1}\]

First let us show uniqueness. 
Assume $z$ and $z'$ both satisfy \ref{eq:thm:connect-1}.
Take a sequence $r_n\to q$ so that $(\dist{p}{r_n}{}-\dist{p}{q}{})/\dist[{{}}]{q}{r_n}{}\to 1$. 
By the triangle inequality, 
\[\dist{z}{r}{}-\dist{z}{q}{},\ \ \dist{z'}{r}{}-\dist{z'}{q}{}\ge \dist{p}{r}{}-\dist{p}{q}{};\] 
thus, as $n\to\infty$,
\[\frac{\dist{z}{r_n}{}-\dist{z}{q}{}}{\dist{q}{r_n}{}},
\ \ 
\frac{\dist{z'}{r_n}{}-\dist{z'}{q}{}}{\dist{q}{r_n}{}}
\to 1.\]
Therefore
 $\angk\kappa q z{r_n},\ \angk\kappa q{z'}{r_n}\to\pi$. (Here we use that $t$ is small, otherwise if $\kappa>0$ the angles might be undefined.)
From (1+3)-point comparison (\ref{df:cbb1+3}), $\angk\kappa q z {z'}=0$ and thus $z=z'$.

The proof of existence is similar.
Choose a sequence $r_n$ as above.
Since $\spc{L}$ is a complete length space, 
there is a sequence $z_\kay\in \spc{L}$ such that $\dist{q}{z_\kay}{},\ \dist{p}{q}{}-\dist{p}{z_\kay}{}\to t$ as $\kay\to\infty$.
Then 
\[
\lim_{n\to\infty}
\lim_{\kay\to\infty}
\angk\kappa q{z_\kay}{r_n}
=\pi.\] 
Thus, for any $\eps>0$ and sufficiently large $n,\kay$, we have $\angk\kappa q{z_\kay}{r_n}>\pi-\eps$.
From (1+3)-point comparison (\ref{df:cbb1+3}), for all large $\kay$ and $j$, we have $\angk\kappa q{z_\kay}{z_j}<2\cdot\eps$ and thus 
\[\dist{z_\kay}{z_j}{}<\eps\cdot\Const(\kappa,t);\]
that is, $\{z_n\}$ converges in itself, and $z=\lim_n z_n$ satisfies \ref{eq:thm:connect-1}.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Give an alternative proof of Theorem \ref{thm:almost.geod} 
built on the fact that geodesics do not split (\ref{thm:g-split})
and Corollary \ref{cor:two-geodesics-in-ultrapower}.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Construct a space $\spc{L}$ be a complete length $\Alex{}$ space
which contains an everywhere dense G-delta set $A$
such that 
$A\cap\l]xy\r[=\emptyset$
for any geodesic $[xy]$ in $\spc{L}$. 
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Let $\spc{L}$ be a complete length $\Alex{}$ space and $A\subset\spc{L}$ be a closed subset.
Show that there is a dense G-delta set $W\subset\spc{L}$ such that
for any $q\in W$ there is unique geodesic $[pq]$ with
$p\in A$ and $\dist{p}{q}{}=\dist{A}{q}{}$.
\end{thm}

\section{More comparisons}\label{sec:more-angles}

Now we are ready to give a number of equivalent definitions of Alexandrov space:

\begin{thm}{Theorem}
\label{thm:defs_of_alex} 
Let $\spc{L}$ be a complete length space. 
Then

\begin{subthm}{3-sum} $\spc{L}$ is $\Alex\kappa$
\end{subthm}
if and only if $\spc{L}$ is G-delta geodesic and one of the following conditions holds for all $p,x,y\in \spc{L}$, once $\modtrig\kappa(p x y)$ is defined:

\begin{subthm}{2-sum} 
(adjacent angle comparison\index{comparison!adjacent angle comparison}) for any geodesic $[x y]$ and $z\in \l]x y\r[$, $z\not=p$ we have
\[\angk\kappa z p x
+\angk\kappa z p y\le \pi.\]
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{point-on-side}
(point-on-side comparison%
\index{point-on-side comparison})
for any geodesic $[x y]$ and $z\in \l]x y\r[$, we have
\[\angk\kappa x p y\le\angk\kappa x p z;\]
or, equivalently, 
\[\dist{\~p}{\~z}{}\le \dist{p}{z}{},\]
where $\trig{\~p}{\~x}{\~y}=\modtrig\kappa(p x y)$, $\~z\in\l] \~x\~y\r[$, $\dist{\~x}{\~z}{}=\dist{x}{z}{}$.
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{angle}(hinge comparison\index{hinge comparison})
for any hinge $\hinge x p y$, the angle 
$\mangle\hinge x p y$ is defined and 
\[\mangle\hinge x p y\ge\angk\kappa x p y,\]
or equivalently
\[\side\kappa \hinge x p y\ge\dist{p}{y}{}.\]
Moreover, if $z\in\l]x y\r[$, $z\not=p$ then 
\[\mangle\hinge z p y + \mangle\hinge z p x\le\pi\]
for any two hinges $\hinge z p y$ and $\hinge z p x$ with common side $[z p]$.
\end{subthm}
\end{thm}

\parbf{Remarks.} 
The monotonicity of model angle with respect to adjacent sidelengths (\ref{SHORT.two-mono-cba}) was named the \emph{convexity property} by Alexandrov.
%???REF???

A bit weaker form of (\ref{SHORT.angle}) 
is given in \ref{lem:devel-glob}.
See also Problem~\ref{open:hinge-}.


\parit{Proof.} By Theorem~\ref{thm:almost.geod}, 
we have that (\ref{SHORT.3-sum}) imples that $\spc{L}$ is G-delta geodesic.

\parit{(\ref{SHORT.3-sum}) $\Rightarrow$ (\ref{SHORT.2-sum})}. Since $z\in \l]x y\r[$, we have $\angk\kappa z x y=\pi$. 
Thus, (1+3)-point comparison
\[\angk\kappa z x y
+\angk\kappa z p x
+\angk\kappa z p y\le2\cdot\pi\]
implies
\[\angk\kappa z p x
+\angk\kappa z p y
\le\pi.\]

\parit{(\ref{SHORT.2-sum}) $\Leftrightarrow$ (\ref{SHORT.point-on-side})}. 
Follows directly from Alexandrov's lemma (\ref{lem:alex}).

\parit{(\ref{SHORT.2-sum}) $+$ (\ref{SHORT.point-on-side}) $\Rightarrow$ (\ref{SHORT.angle}).} 
From (\ref{SHORT.point-on-side}) we get that for $\bar p\in\l]xp\r]$ and $\bar y\in\l]xy\r]$ the function $(\dist{x}{\bar p}{},\dist{x}{\bar y}{})\mapsto\angk\kappa x{\bar p}{\bar y}$ is nonincreasing in each argument.
In particular, 
$\mangle\hinge x p y\z=\sup\{\angk\kappa x{\bar p}{\bar y}\}$.
Thus, $\mangle\hinge x p y$ is defined and it is
at least $\angk\kappa x p y$.

From above and (\ref{SHORT.2-sum}), it follows that $\mangle\hinge z p y + \mangle\hinge z p x\le\pi$.

\begin{wrapfigure}[10]{r}{27mm}
\begin{lpic}[t(0mm),b(0mm),r(0mm),l(0mm)]{pics/angle-comp(1)}
\lbl[r]{1,11;$z$}
\lbl[l]{19,12;$p$}
\lbl[tr]{13,11;$w$}
\lbl[lb]{21,26;$x$}
\lbl[lt]{24,1;$y$}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

\parit{(\ref{SHORT.angle}) $\Rightarrow$ (\ref{SHORT.3-sum}).}
Assume first that $\spc{L}$ is geodesic.
Consider point $w\in \l] p z \r[$ close to $p$.
From (\ref{SHORT.angle}), it follows that 
\[\mangle\hinge w x z+ \mangle\hinge w x{p}\le\pi\ \ \text{and}\ \ \mangle\hinge w y z + \mangle\hinge w y{p}\le\pi.\]
Since $\mangle\hinge w x y\le \mangle\hinge w x p +\mangle\hinge w y{p}$ (see \ref{claim:angle-3angle-inq}), we get 
\[\mangle\hinge w x z+ \mangle\hinge w y z +\mangle\hinge w x y
\le
2\cdot\pi.\]
Applying the first inequality in (\ref{SHORT.angle}), we obtain
\[\angk\kappa w x z
+ \angk\kappa w y z 
+\angk\kappa w x y
\le
2\cdot\pi.\]
Passing to the limits  $w\to p$, we obtain 
\[\angk\kappa p x z 
+ \angk\kappa p y z 
+\angk\kappa p x y
\le
2\cdot\pi.\]

Finally, if $\spc{L}$ is not geodesic, we can apply above arguments for sequences of points $p_n,w_n\to p$, $p_n\in \Str(z)$, $w_n\in\l]z p_n\r[$ and $x_n\to x$, $y_n\to y$, $x_n,y_n\in \Str(w_n)$.
\qeds


\begin{thm}{Angle-sidelength  monotonicity}\label{cor:monoton} 
Let $\spc{L}$ be a complete length $\Alex{\kappa}$ space,
$p,x,y\in \spc{L}$,
$\modtrig\kappa(p x y)$ is defined
and there is a geodesic $[xy]$.
Then for $\bar y\in\l]xy\r]$ the function 
\[\dist{x}{\bar y}{}\mapsto \angk\kappa x p{\bar y}\] 
is nonincreasing.

In particular, if geodesic $[x p]$ exists and $\bar p\in \l]x p\r]$ then
\begin{subthm}{cor:monoton:2-sides}
the function 
\[(\dist{x}{\bar y}{},\dist{x}{\bar p}{})\mapsto \angk\kappa x {\bar p}{\bar y}\] is nonincresing in each argument
\end{subthm}
 
\begin{subthm}{cor:monoton:sup}
The angle $\mangle\hinge{x}{p}{y}$ is defined and 
\[\mangle\hinge{x}{p}{y}
=
\sup\set{\angk\kappa x {\bar p}{\bar y}}{
\bar p\in\l]xp\r],\ 
\bar y\in\l]xy\r]}.\]

\end{subthm}
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
See the first part of (\ref{SHORT.2-sum})$+$(\ref{SHORT.point-on-side})$\Rightarrow$(\ref{SHORT.angle}) in the proof of \ref{thm:defs_of_alex}.\qeds

\begin{thm}{Exercise} 
Let $\spc{L}$ be a complete length $\Alex{\kappa}$ space,
$p,x,y\in \spc{L}$
and $v,w\in \l]xy\r[$.
Prove that  
\[
\angk\kappa xyp=\angk\kappa xvp
\ \ \Leftrightarrow\ \ 
\angk\kappa xyp=\angk\kappa xwp.
\]

\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Advanced Exercise} \label{ex:urysohn}
Construct a geodesic space $\spc{X}$ which is not $\Alex0$, 
but which meets the following condition: for any 3 points $p,x,y\in \spc{X}$ there is a geodesic $[x y]$ such that for any $z\in \l]x y\r[$
\[\angk{0}{z}{p}{x}+\angk{0}{z}{p}{y}

\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Advanced Exercise}\label{ex:lebedeva-petrunin}

\end{thm}

Assume that for a trianglle $\trig{x^1}{x^2}{x^3}$ in a metric space its $\kappa$-model triangle
$\trig{\~x^1}{\~x^2}{\~x^3}=\modtrig\kappa({x^1}{x^2}{x^3})$ is defined.
We say the triangle $\trig{x^1}{x^2}{x^3}$ is \emph{$\kappa$-fat}\index{$\kappa$-fat} if the natural map (see definition \ref{def:k-thin}) 
$\trig{\~x^1}{\~x^2}{\~x^3}\to \trig{x^1}{x^2}{x^3}$ is distance non contracting.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}

\section{Function comparison and development} \label{sec:func-comp-CBB}

In this section we will translate the angle comparison definitions (Theorem~\ref{thm:defs_of_alex}) 
to a concavity-like property of the distance functions as defined in Section~\ref{sec:conv-fun}.
Conceptually, this is quite important step;
we reformulate a global geometric condition into an infinitesimal condition on distance functions.
We will give two formulation of this comparison:
analytical, using function concavity, and geometrical, using development.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:conc} 
Let $\spc{L}$ be a complete length space. 
Then the following 
statements are equivalent:

\begin{subthm}{main-def'} $\spc{L}$ is $\Alex\kappa$.
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{comp-kappa}(function comparison\index{comparison!function comparison}) $\spc{L}$ is  G-delta geodesic and for any $p\in \spc{L}$, the function $f=\md\kappa\circ\dist{p}{}{}$ satisfies the differential inequality
\[f''\le 1-\kappa\cdot f.\]
in $\oBall(p,\varpi\kappa)$.
\end{subthm}
\end{thm}

In particular, a complete G-delta geodesic space $\spc{L}$ is $\Alex{0}$ if and only if for any $p\in \spc{L}$, the function $\dist[2]{p}{}{}\:\spc{L}\to\RR$ 
is $2$-concave as defined in Section~\ref{sec:conv-fun}.

\parit{Proof.} 
Given a geodesic $[x y]$  in $\oBall(p,\varpi\kappa)$,
let $\ell=\dist{x}{y}{}$.
Consider model triangle $\trig{\~p}{\~x}{\~y}=\modtrig\kappa(p x y)$ and set \begin{align*} 
\~r(t)&=\dist{\~p}{\geod_{[\~x\~y]}(t)}{},
& 
r(t)&=\dist{p}{\geod_{[xy]}(t)}{}.                           \end{align*}
Clearly $\~r(0)=r(0)$ and $\~r(\ell)=r(\ell)$. 
Set $\~f=\md\kappa\circ\~r$ and $f=\md\kappa\circ r$.
From \ref{md-diff-eq} we get $\~f''=1-\kappa\cdot  \~f$.

Note that the point-on-side comparison (\ref{point-on-side}) for point $p$ and geodesic $[x y]$ is equivalent to $\~r\le r$.
Since $\md\kappa$ is increasing on $[0,\varpi\kappa)$, 
$\~r\le r$ is equivalent to $\~f\le f$, which is Jensen's inequality (\ref{y''-mono}) for the function
$t\mapsto\md\kappa\dist[{{}}]{p}{\geod_{[x y]}(t)}{}$ on interval $[0,\ell]$. 
Hence the result.

Recall that Busemann functions defined in Proposition \ref{prop:busemann}.
The following exercise is analogous to Exercise~\ref{ex:busemann-CBA}.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:busemann-CBB}
Let $\spc{L}$ be a complete length $\Alex{\kappa}$ space
and $\bus_\gamma\:\spc{L}\to \RR$ is the Busemann function for a ray $\gamma\:[0,\infty)\to \spc{L}$.

\begin{subthm}{}
If $\kappa=0$ then the Busemann function $\bus_\gamma$ is  concave.
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{}
If $\kappa=-1$ then the function 
\[f=\exp\circ\bus_\gamma\] 
satisfies
\[f''- f\le 0\]
\end{subthm}

\end{thm}


We will translate the above comparison into more geometric language, using the following definition of $\kappa$-\nospace development.
This definition appears in \cite{alexandrov:devel}
and an earlier fom of it can be found in \cite{liberman}.
The definition is somewhat lengthy, but it defines a useful comparison object for a curve. 
Often it is easier to write proofs in terms of function comparison,
but think in terms of $\kappa$-developments.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:devel}
Let $\kappa\in \RR$, 
$\spc{X}$ be a metric space, 
$\gamma\:\II\to \spc{X}$ be a $1$-Lipschitz curve,
$p\in \spc{X}$,
$\~p\in\Lob2{\kappa}$
and $0<\dist{p}{\gamma(t)}{} < \varpi\kappa$ for
all $t\in \II$.
Then there exists a unique up to rotation curve
$\~\gamma\: \II\to \Lob2\kappa$, parameterized by the arc-length 
such that
$\dist{\~p}{\~\gamma(t)}{}=\dist{p}{\gamma(t)}{}$ for all $t$
and the direction of
$[\~p\~\gamma(t)]$ monotonically turns around $\~p$ conterclockwise, as $t$ increases.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Definition of development}\label{def:devel}
If $p,\~p,\gamma,\~\gamma$ be as in Lemma~\ref{lem:devel}
then $\~\gamma$ is called the \emph{$\kappa$-development of $\gamma$
with respect to $p$}\index{development}; 
the point $\~p$ is called \emph{the basepoint of development}\index{base of development}.
When we say that the $\kappa$-development of $\gamma$ with respect to $p$ is \emph{defined} we allways assume that $0<\dist{p}{\gamma(t)}{} < \varpi\kappa$ for
all 
$t\in \II$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof of Lemma~\ref{lem:devel}.}
Consider functions $\rho$, $\theta\:\II\to\RR$ defined as 
\begin{align*}
\rho(t)
&=\dist{p}{\gamma(t)}{},
&
\theta(t)
&=
\int\limits_{t_0}^{t}
\frac{\sqrt{1-(\rho'(\under{t}))^2}}{\sn\kappa\circ\rho(\under{t})}\cdot\d\under{t},
\end{align*}
where $t_0\in\II$ is a fixed number and $\int$ stays for Lebesgue integral.
Since $\gamma$ is $1$-Lipshitz, so is $\rho(t)$ and thus, the function $\theta$ is defined and non decreasing.

It is straightforward to check that $(\rho,\theta)$ describe $\~\gamma$ in polar coordinates on $\Lob2{\kappa}$ with center at $\~p$.

We need the following analogues of sub- and super-graphs%??? change to epi- hypo???
 and convex/concave functions, adapted to polar coordiantes in $\Lob2{\kappa}$.

\begin{thm}{Definition}\label{def:convex-devel}
Let $\~\gamma\:\II\to\Lob2\kappa$ be a curve and $\~p\in\Lob2\kappa$ such that there is unique geodesic $[\~p\,\~\gamma(t)]$ for any $t\in\II$ and the direction of $[\~p\,\~\gamma(t)]$ turns monotonically as $t$ grows.

The set formed by all geodesics from  $\~p$ to the points on $\~\gamma$ is called the \emph{subgraph} of $\~\gamma$ with respect to $\~p$.

The set of all points $\~x\in\Lob2{\kappa}$ such that a geodesic $[\~p\~x]$ intersect $\~\gamma$ is called the \emph{supergraph} of $\~\gamma$ with respect to $\~p$.

The curve $\~\gamma$ is called \emph{convex (concave) with respect to}\index{convex!convex with respect to a point} $\~p$ if the subgraph (supergraph) of $\~\gamma$ with respect to $\~p$ is convex.

The curve $\~\gamma$ is called 
\emph{locally convex (concave) with respect to}\index{convex!locally convex development with respect to a point} $\~p$ 
if for any interior value $t_0$ in $\II$ there is a subsegment $(a,b)\subset\II$, $(a,b)\z\ni t_0$, such that the restriction $\~\gamma|(a,b)$ is convex (concave) with respect to $\~p$.

%???THERE IS LITTLE PROBLEM IN CASE IF CURVE GOES AROUND BASE FEW TIMES!!!
\end{thm}

Note that if $\kappa>0$ then the supergraph of a curve is a subgraph with respect to the opposite point. 

For developments,
all the notions above will be considered with respect to their basepoints.
In particular, if $\~\gamma$ is a development, we will say it is \emph{(locally) convex} if it is (locally) convex with respect to its basepoint.




\begin{thm}{Development comparison\index{comparison!development comparison}}\label{thm:devel} 
$\spc{L}$ is a complete length $\Alex\kappa$ space if and only if $\spc{L}$ is G-delta geodesic and for any point $p\in \spc{L}$ and any geodesic $\gamma$ in $\oBall(p,\varpi\kappa)\backslash\{p\}$, its $\kappa$-development with respect to $p$ is convex.

\parit{Proof; ($\Rightarrow$).}  
By Theorem~\ref{thm:almost.geod}, $\spc{L}$ is G-delta geodesic.

Let $\gamma\:[0,T]\to \oBall(p,\varpi\kappa)\backslash \{p\}$ be a unit-speed geodesic in $\spc{L}$.
Consider partition $0=t_0<t_1<\dots<t_n=T$.
Set $x_i=\gamma(t_i)$.
Let us construct a chain of model triangles 
$\trig{\~p}{\~x_{i-1}}{\~x_i}=\modtrig\kappa(p x_{i-1}x_i)$ in such a way that direction $[\~p\~x_i]$ turns conterclockwise as $i$ grows.
Condition~\ref{2-sum} implies  that 
\[\mangle\hinge{\~x_i}{\~x_{i-1}}{\~p}
+\mangle\hinge{\~x_i}{\~x_{i+1}}{\~p}
\le\pi.\eqlbl{eq:thm:devel*}\]
Further, since $\gamma$ is a unit-speed geodesic, we have that 
\[\sum_{i=1}^n\dist{x_{i-1}}{x_i}{}\le \dist{p}{x_0}{}+\dist{p}{x_n}{}.\eqlbl{eq:thm:detr*}\]

If $\kappa\le 0$ then \ref{eq:thm:detr*} immediately implies that 

\[\sum_{i=1}^n\mangle\hinge{\~p}{\~x_i}{\~x_{i-1}}\le\pi.
\eqlbl{eq:thm:devel**}\] 

If $\kappa>0$ then \ref{eq:thm:devel**} require more work.
Applying rescaling we can assume that $\kappa=1$.
Assume the contrary; 
that is, $\sum_{i=1}^n\mangle\hinge{\~p}{\~x_i}{\~x_{i-1}}>\pi$,
then for some $\kay$ there is a point $\~y\in[\~x_{\kay}\~x_{\kay+1}]$ such that
\[\mangle\hinge{\~p}{\~x_0}{\~x_{1}}
+
\dots
+
\mangle\hinge{\~p}{\~x_{\kay-1}}{\~x_\kay}
+
\mangle\hinge{\~p}{\~x_{\kay}}{\~y}
=\pi.\]
By \ref{eq:thm:detr*}, 
the broken line $\~x_0\~x_1\dots\~x_\kay\~y$
is convex; in particular,
\[
\dist{\~p}{\~x_0}{\SS^2}+\dist{\~p}{\~y}{\SS^2}\le\pi\]
By triangle inequality
\[\dist{\~x_0}{\~x_{1}}{\SS^2}+\dots+\dist{\~x_{\kay-1}}{\~x_\kay}{\SS^2}+\dist{\~x_\kay}{\~y}{\SS^2}\ge \dist{\~p}{\~x_0}{\SS^2}+\dist{\~p}{\~y}{\SS^2}\]
Applying the triangle inequality again, 
we get
\[\dist{\~y}{\~x_{\kay+1}}{\SS^2}+\dist{\~x_{\kay+1}}{\~x_{\kay+2}}{\SS^2}+\dots+\dist{\~x_{n-1}}{\~x_n}{\SS^2}> \dist{\~p}{\~x_n}{\SS^2}-\dist{\~p}{\~y}{\SS^2}\]

Hence
\[T=\sum_{i=1}^n\dist{\~x_i}{\~x_{i-1}}{\SS^2}>\dist{\~p}{\~x_{0}}{\SS^2}+\dist{\~p}{\~x_n}{\SS^2}.\]
The later contradicts that $\gamma$ is length minimizing.


Inequalities \ref{eq:thm:devel*} and \ref{eq:thm:devel**} imply that the polygon $[\~p\~x_0\~x_1\dots \~x_n]$ is convex.

Let us take finer and finer partitions and pass to the limit of the polygon $\~p\~x_0\~x_1\dots \~x_n$.
We obtain a convex curvelinear triangle formed by a curve $\~\gamma\:[0,T]\to\Lob2{\kappa}$ which is  the limit of broken line $\~x_0\~x_1\dots \~x_n$ and two geodesics $[\~p\,\~\gamma(0)]$,
$[\~p\,\~\gamma(T)]$.
Since $[\~p\~x_0\~x_1\dots \~x_n]$ is convex,
 the natural parametrization of $\~x_0\~x_1\dots \~x_n$ 
converges to a natural parametrization of $\~\gamma$ (see \ref{lem:lenght-of-convex-curve}).
Thus $\~\gamma$ is the $\kappa$-development of $\gamma$ with respect to $p$.

\noi{($\Leftarrow$).}
Assuming convexity of the development, we will prove the point-on-side comparison (\ref{point-on-side}). 
We can assume that $p\notin [x y]$; otherwise the statement is trivial.

Set $T=\dist{x}{y}{}$ and $\gamma(t)=\geod_{[x y]}(t)$ it is a geodesic in $\oBall(p,\varpi\kappa)\backslash \{p\}$.
Let $\~\gamma\:[0,T]\to\Lob2\kappa$ be $\kappa$-development with base $\~p$ of $\gamma$ with respect to $p$.
Take a partition $0=t_0<t_1<\dots<t_n=T$ and set 
\[\~y_i=\~\gamma(t_i)\ \ \text{and}\ \ \tau_i=\dist{\~y_0}{\~y_1}{}+\dist{\~y_1}{\~y_2}{}+\dots+\dist{\~y_{i-1}}{\~y_i}{}.\] 
Since $\~\gamma$ is convex, for a fine partition we have that broken line $\~y_0\~y_1\dots\~y_n$ is also convex.
Applying Alexandrov's lemma (\ref{lem:alex}) inductively to pairs of triangles 
$\modtrig\kappa
\{\tau_{i-1},\dist{\~p}{\~y_0}{},\dist{\~p}{\~y_{i-1}}{}\}$ and 
$\modtrig\kappa
\{\dist{\~y_{i-1}}{\~y_i}{},\dist{\~p}{\~y_{i-1}}{},\dist{\~p}{\~y_{i}}{}\}$,
we obtain that sequence 
$\~\mangle\mc\kappa\{\dist{\~p}{\~y_{i}}{};\dist{\~p}{\~y_0}{},\tau_i\}$ is non increasing.

For finer and finer partitions we have 
\[\max\nolimits_i\{|\tau_i-t_i|\}\to0.\] 
Thus, point-on-side comparison (\ref{point-on-side}) follows.

\section{Local definitions and globalization}\label{sec:loc}


The aim of this section is giving 
local analogs of $\Alex{\kappa}$ spaces 
and proving the equivalence to the global definitions 
--- so called globalization theorem.

First we need a local analog of the notion of a G-delta geodesic space (definition \ref{def:alm-geod}):

\begin{thm}{Definition}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a complete length space. 
An open set $\Omega\subset\spc{X}$ is called G-delta geodesic if for every point $p\in\Omega$ there is a G-delta set $W_p$ which is dense in $\Omega$ such that
for any $q\in W_p$ there is a geodesic $[p q]$ in $\spc{X}$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:=def-loc}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a complete length space and $p\in \spc{X}$.
Then the following conditions are equivalent:
\begin{subthmN}
{curv>=k}(local (1+3)-point comparison) there is $R_{\hbox{\rm\scriptsize\ref{SHORT.curv>=k}}}>0$ such that comparison 
\[\angk\kappa q{x^1}{x^2}
+\angk\kappa q{x^2}{x^3}
+\angk\kappa q{x^3}{x^1}
\le 2\cdot\pi\]
holds for any $q,x^1,x^2,x^3\in \oBall(p,R_{\hbox{\rm\scriptsize\ref{SHORT.curv>=k}}})$.
\end{subthmN}

\begin{subthmN}{def:kirszbraun-loc}(local Kirszbraun property) 
there is $R_{\hbox{\rm\scriptsize\ref{SHORT.def:kirszbraun-loc}}}>0$, 
such that for any 3-point subset $F_3$ and any 4-point subset $F_4\supset F_3$ in $\oBall(p,R_{\hbox{\rm\scriptsize\ref{SHORT.def:kirszbraun-loc}}})$, any short map $f\:F_3\to\Lob2\kappa$ can be extended as a short map $\bar f\:F_4\to\Lob2\kappa$ (so $f=\bar f|F_3$).
\end{subthmN}

\begin{subthmN}{conc-loc} (local function comparison) there is 
$R_{\hbox{\rm\scriptsize\ref{SHORT.conc-loc}}}>0$, such that 
$\oBall(p,R_{\hbox{\rm\scriptsize\ref{SHORT.conc-loc}}})$ 
is G-delta geodesic and for any 
$q\in \oBall(p,R_{\hbox{\rm\scriptsize\ref{SHORT.conc-loc}}})$, 
the function $f=\md\kappa\circ\dist{q}{}{}$ satisfies 
$f''\le 1-\kappa\cdot  f$ in
$\oBall(p,R_{\hbox{\rm\scriptsize\ref{SHORT.conc-loc}}})$.
\end{subthmN}

\begin{subthmN}{2-sum-loc} (local adjacent angle comparison) there is
$R_{\hbox{\rm\scriptsize\ref{SHORT.2-sum-loc}}}>0$ 
such that $\oBall(p,R_{\hbox{\rm\scriptsize\ref{SHORT.2-sum-loc}}})$ 
is G-delta geodesic and if $q$ and geodesic $[x y]$ lie in
$\oBall(p,R_{\hbox{\rm\scriptsize\ref{SHORT.2-sum-loc}}})$ and 
$z\in \l]x y\r[$ then
\[\angk\kappa z q x
+\angk\kappa z q y
\le \pi.\]
\end{subthmN}

\begin{subthmN}{monoton-loc} (local point-on-side comparison) 
there is $R_{\hbox{\rm\scriptsize\ref{SHORT.monoton-loc}}}>0$, 
such that $\oBall(p,R_{\hbox{\rm\scriptsize\ref{SHORT.monoton-loc}}})$ is G-delta geodesic and if $q$ and geodesic $[x y]$ lie in $\oBall(p,R_{\hbox{\rm\scriptsize\ref{SHORT.monoton-loc}}})$ 
and $z\in \l]x y\r[$, we have
\[\angk\kappa x q y
\le\angk\kappa x q z;\]
or, equivalently, 
\[\dist{\~p}{\~z}{}\le \dist{p}{z}{},\]
where $\trig{\~p}{\~x}{\~y}=\modtrig\kappa(p x y)$, $\~z\in\l] \~x\~y\r[$, $\dist{\~x}{\~z}{}=\dist{x}{z}{}$.
\end{subthmN}

\begin{subthmN}{angle-loc} (local hinge comparison) 
there is $R_{\hbox{\rm\scriptsize\ref{SHORT.angle-loc}}}>0$, such that $\oBall(p,R_{\hbox{\rm\scriptsize\ref{SHORT.angle-loc}}})$ is G-delta geodesic and if $x\in \oBall(p,R_{\hbox{\rm\scriptsize\ref{SHORT.angle-loc}}})$ then (1) for any hinge $\hinge x q y$, the angle 
$\mangle\hinge x q y$ is defined and (2) if $x\in \l]y z\r[$ then%
\footnote{Let us remind that $\hinge x q y$ and $\hinge x q z$  are short notations for pairs $([x q],[x y])$ and $([x q],[x z])$, 
thus these two hinges automatically have common side $[x q]$.}
\[\mangle\hinge x q y+ \mangle\hinge x q z\le\pi.\]
Moreover, if hinge $\hinge x q y$ lies in $\oBall(p,R_{\hbox{\rm\scriptsize\ref{SHORT.angle-loc}}})$ then 
\[\mangle\hinge x q y
\ge\angk\kappa x q y.\]
or equivalently
\[\side\kappa \hinge x q y\ge\dist{q}{ y}{}.\]
\end{subthmN}


\begin{subthmN}{def:devel-alex-loc}(local development comparison) 
there is $R_{\hbox{\rm\scriptsize\ref{SHORT.def:devel-alex-loc}}}>0$, 
such that $\oBall(p,R_{\hbox{\rm\scriptsize\ref{SHORT.def:devel-alex-loc}}})$ 
is G-delta geodesic and if a geodesic $\gamma$ lies in $\oBall(p,R_{\hbox{\rm\scriptsize\ref{SHORT.def:devel-alex-loc}}})$ and $q\in 
\oBall(p,R_{\hbox{\rm\scriptsize\ref{SHORT.def:devel-alex-loc}}})
\backslash \gamma$ then the $\kappa$-development $\~\gamma$ with respect to $q$ is convex.
\end{subthmN}
Moreover, for each pair $i,j\in \{1,2,\dots,7\}$ we can assume that $R_i>\tfrac{1}{9}\cdot R_j$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.} The proof of each equivalence repeats the proof of corresponding global equivalence in localized form; see proofs of theorems \ref{thm:defs_of_alex}, \ref{thm:conc}, \ref{def:devel}, \ref{thm:kirsz-def}. \qeds

Now, let us give a local definition of lower curvature bound (\ref{df:cbb1+3}).

\begin{thm}{Definition}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a metric space and $p\in \spc{X}$, 
we say that \emph{$\spc{X}$ has curvature $\ge\Kappa$ at $p$} 
(briefly, $\curv_p \spc{X}\ge\Kappa$) 
if $p$ satisfies any of the equivalent condition of Theorem~\ref{thm:=def-loc} for any $\kappa<\Kappa$.
\end{thm}



\begin{thm}{Globalization theorem}\label{thm:glob} 
Let $\spc{L}$ be a complete length metric space such that $\curv_p \spc{L}\ge\Kappa$ for any point $p\in \spc{L}$ then $\spc{L}$ is $\Alex\Kappa$.
\end{thm}

In the two-dimensional case this theorem was proved in \cite{alexandrov:devel}, later, in \cite{toponogov-globalization+splitting} it was proved for Riemannian manifolds of all dimensions.
In the above generality, the theorem first appears in \cite{BGP}; simplifications and modifications were given in \cite{plaut:dimension}, \cite{shiohama}, \cite{BBI}.
Our proof, is based on presentations in  \cite{plaut:dimension} and \cite{BBI}.

The following corollary says that the expression ``space with curvature $\ge \kappa$'' makes sense.

\begin{thm}{Corollary}\label{cor:CAT>k-sence}
Let $\spc{L}$ be a complete length space.
Then $\spc{L}$ is $\Alex\Kappa$ if and only if $\spc{L}$ is $\Alex\kappa$ for any $\kappa<\Kappa$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Note that if $\Kappa\le 0$, this statement follows directly from definition of Alexandrov space (\ref{df:cbb1+3}) and monotonicity of the function $\kappa\mapsto\angk\kappa x y z$ (\ref{k-decrease}).

The ``if''-part also follows directly from definition.

For $\Kappa>0$, the angle $\angk{\Kappa} x y z$ might be undefined, but, it is defined for sufficiently small triangles.
Thus, if $\Kappa>\kappa$ then any $\Alex\Kappa$ space is locally $\Alex\kappa$
Applying  globalization theorem (\ref{thm:glob}), we get the ``only if''-part.
\qeds

For the proof of globalization theorem,
will need three lemmas.
First we need the following characterization of Alexandrov space; 
it coinsides with \ref{angle} if $\kappa\le 0$ and slightly weaker in case $\kappa>0$.


\begin{thm}{Short hinge lemma}\label{lem:devel-glob}
Let $\spc{L}$ be a complete G-delta geodesic space such that for any hinge $\hinge x p y$ in $\spc{L}$ the angle $\mangle\hinge x p y$ is defined 
and moreover, if $x\in \l]y z\r[$ then
\[\mangle\hinge x p y+\mangle\hinge x p z\le \pi.\] 

Assume that  for any hinge $\hinge x p y$ in $\spc{L}$ we have
\[\dist{p}{ x}{}+\dist{x}{ y}{}
<\varpi\kappa
\quad\Rightarrow\quad 
\mangle\hinge x p y
\ge\angk\kappa x p y,\]
then $\spc{L}$ is $\Alex\kappa$.
\end{thm}

%???THE PROOF IS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO {thm:devel}, MAYBE IT IS BETTER TO MAKE IT ONCE???

\parit{Proof.} 
If $\kappa\le0$, the lemma follows directly from the hinge comparison (\ref{angle}).
For $\kappa>0$ the proof is very similar to the proof of equivalence of development comparison definition (\ref{thm:devel}).

Applying rescaling, we can assume that $\kappa=1$, 
therefore $\Lob{2}\kappa=\SS^2$ and $\varpi\kappa=\pi$.

According to \ref{thm:devel}, it is sufficient to show that  for any point $p\in \spc{L}$ and any geodesic $\gamma\:[0,T]\to \oBall(p,\pi)\backslash \{p\}$, its $\kappa$-development with respect to $p$ is convex.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{26mm}

\lbl[b]{8,24.5;$.$}}
\lbl[rt]{2,18.5;$\~x_n$}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

Clearly $\dist{p}{\gamma(t)}{}<\pi-\eps$ for some fixed $\eps>0$.
Consider partition $0=t_0<t_1<\dots<t_n=T$ such that $|t_i-t_{i-1}|<\eps$.
Set $x_i=\gamma(t_i)$ 
and choose a point $p'\in \Str(x_0,x_1,\dots,x_n)$ sufficiently close to $p$.
Construct a chain of model triangles 
$\trig{\~p'}{\~x_{i-1}}{\~x_i}=\modtrig\kappa(p' x_{i-1}x_i)$ on such a way that direction $[\~p'\~x_i]$ turns conterclockwise as $i$ grows.
From the assumption of the lemma, 
\[\begin{aligned}
\mangle\hinge {\~x_i}{\~x_{i-1}}{\~p'}
+\mangle\hinge{\~x_i}{\~x_{i+1}}{\~p'}
&=
\angk\kappa{x_i}{x_{i-1}}{p'}
+\angk\kappa{x_i}{x_{i+1}}{p'}
\le
\\
&\le
\mangle\hinge{x_i}{x_{i-1}}{p'}
+\mangle\hinge{x_i}{x_{i+1}}{p'}
\le
\\
&\le
\pi.
\end{aligned}\eqlbl{eq:angles=<pi}
\]

Note that
\[\sum_{i=1}^n\mangle\hinge{\~p'}{\~x_i}{\~x_{i-1}}\le\pi\eqlbl{clm:T>2sides}\]
Indeed, if $\sum_{i=1}^n\mangle\hinge{\~p'}{\~x_i}{\~x_{i-1}}>\pi$,
then for some $\kay$ there is a point $\~y\in[\~x_{\kay}\~x_{\kay+1}]$ such that
\[\mangle\hinge{\~p'}{\~x_0}{\~x_{1}}
+
\dots
+
\mangle\hinge{\~p'}{\~x_{\kay-1}}{\~x_\kay}
+
\mangle\hinge{\~p'}{\~x_{\kay}}{\~y}
=\pi.\]
By \ref{eq:angles=<pi}, 
the broken line $\~x_0\~x_1\dots\~x_\kay\~y$
is convex; in particular,
\[
\dist{\~p'}{\~x_0}{\SS^2}+\dist{\~p'}{\~y}{\SS^2}\le\pi\]
Therefore, by triangle inequality
\[\dist{\~x_0}{\~x_{1}}{\SS^2}+\dots+\dist{\~x_{\kay-1}}{\~x_\kay}{\SS^2}+\dist{\~x_\kay}{\~y}{\SS^2}\ge \dist{\~p'}{\~x_0}{\SS^2}+\dist{\~p'}{\~y}{\SS^2}\]
Applying the triangle inequality again, 
we get
\[\dist{\~y}{\~x_{\kay+1}}{\SS^2}+\dist{\~x_{\kay+1}}{\~x_{\kay+2}}{\SS^2}+\dots+\dist{\~x_{n-1}}{\~x_n}{\SS^2}> \dist{\~p'}{\~x_n}{\SS^2}-\dist{\~p'}{\~y}{\SS^2}\]

Hence
\[T=\sum_{i=1}^n\dist{\~x_i}{\~x_{i-1}}{\SS^2}>\dist{\~p'}{\~x_{0}}{\SS^2}+\dist{\~p'}{\~x_n}{\SS^2}.\]
The later contradicts that $\gamma$ is length minimizing.

From \ref{eq:angles=<pi} and \ref{clm:T>2sides}, it follows that the spherical polygon $[\~p'\~x_0\~x_1\dots \~x_n]$ is convex.

Taking finer and finer partitions and passing to the limit $p'\to p$, the broken line $\~x_0\~x_1\dots \~x_n$ approaches development of $\gamma$ with respect to $p$ and the statement follows.

The following lemma says that if comparison holds for all small hinges then it holds for slightly bigger hinges near the given point.

\begin{thm}{Key lemma}\label{key-lem:globalization} 
Let $\kappa\in \RR$, 
$0<\ell\le\varpi\kappa$, 
$\spc{X}$ be a complete geodesic space 
and $p\in \spc{X}$ be a point 
such that $\curv_x \spc{X}\ge\kappa$ for any $x\in \oBall(p,2\cdot\ell)$. 

Assume that for any point 
$q\in \oBall(p,{\ell})$, comparison
\[\mangle\hinge x y q
\ge\angk\kappa x y q\]
holds for any hinge $\hinge x y q$ with 
$\dist{x}{y}{}+\dist{x}{q}{}
<
\frac{2}{3}\cdot\ell$.
Then comparison
\[\mangle\hinge x p q
\ge\angk\kappa x p q\] 
holds for any hinge $\hinge x p q$ with $\dist{x}{ p}{}+\dist{x}{q}{}<\ell$.
\end{thm}

\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

\parit{Proof of key lemma (\ref{key-lem:globalization}) .} 
We will prove an equivalent inequality:
\[\side\kappa \hinge x p q
\ge\dist{p}{q}{}.\eqlbl{eq:thm:=def-loc*}\] 
for any hinge $\hinge x p q$ with $\dist{x}{p}{}+\dist{x}{q}{}<\ell$.

Fix $q$.
Consider a hinge $\hinge x p q$ such that 
\[\tfrac{2}{3}\cdot\ell \le\dist{p}{x}{}\z+\dist{x}{q}{}< \ell.\]
Let us construct a new hinge $\hinge{x'}p q$ which is smaller; that is,
\[
\dist{p}{x}{}+\dist{x}{q}{}\ge\dist{p}{x'}{}+\dist{x'}{q}{}
\eqlbl{eq:thm:=def-loc-fourstar}\]
and such that 
\[\side\kappa \hinge x p q
\ge\side\kappa \hinge{x'}p q.
\eqlbl{eq:thm:=def-loc-fivestar}\]

%\parit{Construction of $\hinge{x'}p q$.}
Assume $\dist{x}{q}{}\ge\dist{x}{p}{}$, otherwise switch the roles of $p$ and $q$ in the following construction.
Take $x'\in [x q]$ such that 
\[\dist{p}{x}{}+3\cdot\dist[{{}}]{x}{x'}{}
=\tfrac{2}{3}\cdot\ell \eqlbl{3|xx'|}\]
Choose a geodesic $[x' p]$ and consider the  hinge $\hinge{x'}p q$ fromed by $[x'p]$ and $[x' q]\subset [x q]$. 
(In fact the same argument as in \ref{thm:g-split} shows that 
condition $[x' q]\subset [x q]$ always holds.)

Then \ref{eq:thm:=def-loc-fourstar} follows from the triangle inequality.

Further, note that we have $x,x'\in \oBall(p,\ell)\cap \oBall(q,\ell)$ and moreover
$\dist{p}{x}{}\z+\dist{x}{x'}{},\dist{p}{x'}{}\z+\dist{x'}{x}{}<\tfrac{2}{3}\cdot\ell $.
In particular, 

\[\mangle\hinge x p{x'}
\ge\angk\kappa x p{x'}
\ \ \text{and}\ \ 
\mangle\hinge {x'}p x
\ge\angk\kappa {x'}p x.
\eqlbl{eq:thm:=def-loc-threestar}\]


Now, let 
$\trig{\~x}{\~x'}{\~p}=\modtrig\kappa(x x' p)$.
Take $\~ q$ on the extension of $[\~ x\~ x']$ beyond $x'$ such that $\dist{\~x}{\~q}{}=\dist{x}{q}{}$ (and therefore $\dist{\~x'}{\~q}{}=\dist{x'}{q}{}$).
From \ref{eq:thm:=def-loc-threestar},
\[\mangle\hinge x p q
=\mangle\hinge  x p{x'}\ge\angk\kappa x p{x'}\ \ \Rightarrow\ \ 
\side\kappa \hinge x q p\ge\dist{\~p}{\~q}{}.\]
From the assumptions of the lemma, we have $\mangle\hinge{x'}p x+\mangle\hinge{x'}p q\le \pi$; 
thus \ref{eq:thm:=def-loc-threestar} implies
\[
\pi
-\angk\kappa{x'}p x
\ge
\pi-\mangle\hinge{x'}p x
\ge
\mangle\hinge{x'}p q.
\]
Therefore
$\dist{\~p}{\~q}{}\ge\side\kappa \hinge{x'}q p$ and \ref{eq:thm:=def-loc-fivestar} follows.

%%%??? WE SHOULD MENTION cat's cradle.
Let us continue the proof.
Set $x_0=x$.
Let us apply inductively the above construction to get a sequence of hinges  $\hinge{x_n}p q$ with $x_{n+1}=x_n'$.

The sequence might terminate at some $n$ only if $\dist{p}{x_n}{}+\dist{x_n}{q}{}\z< \tfrac{2}{3}\cdot\ell $.
In this case, by the assumptions of the lemma, $\side\kappa \hinge{x_n}p q\ge\dist{p}{q}{}$.
From \ref{eq:thm:=def-loc-fivestar}, we get that the sequence  $s_n\z=\side\kappa \hinge{x_n}p q$ is decreasing.
Hence inequality \ref{eq:thm:=def-loc*} follows.

Otherwise, the sequence $r_n=\dist{p}{x_n}{}+\dist{x_n}{q}{}$ is non-increasing and $r_n\ge\tfrac{2}{3}\cdot\ell$ for all $n$. Hence $r_n\to r$ as $n\to\infty$.
Pass to a subsequence $y_\kay=x_{n_\kay}$ such that $y_\kay'=x_{n_\kay+1}\in [y_\kay q]$.
(In particular, $\dist{y_\kay}{q}{}\ge\dist{y_\kay}{p}{}$.)
Clearly, \[\dist{p}{y_\kay}{}+\dist{y_\kay}{y_\kay'}{}\z-\dist{p}{y_\kay'}{}=r_\kay-r_{\kay+1}\underset{\kay\to\infty} {\to}0.
\eqlbl{trig=}\]
From \ref{3|xx'|}, 
it follows that  $\dist{y_\kay}{y'_\kay}{}\z>\tfrac{\ell}{100}$.
From \ref{3|xx'|} and \ref{trig=}, it follows that 
$\dist{p}{y_\kay}{}\z>\tfrac{\ell}{100}$
for all large $\kay$.
Therefore, $\angk\kappa{y_\kay}p{y_\kay'}\to \pi$. 
Since 
$\mangle\hinge{y_\kay}p{y_\kay'}
\ge\angk\kappa{y_\kay}p{y_\kay'}$, we have 
$\mangle\hinge{y_\kay}p q=\mangle\hinge{y_\kay}p{y_\kay'}\to \pi$.
Therefore, 
\[\dist{p}{y_\kay}{}+\dist{y_\kay}{q}{}-\side\kappa \hinge{y_\kay}p q\to 0.\] 
(Here we used that $\ell\le\varpi\kappa$.) 
Together with the triangle inequality
\[
\dist{p}{y_\kay}{}+\dist{y_\kay}{q}{}\ge\dist{p}{q}{}
\]
this yields
\[\lim_{n\to\infty}\side\kappa \hinge{y_\kay}p q\ge \dist{p}{q}{}.\]
Applying monotonicity of sequence  $s_n=\side\kappa \hinge{y_\kay}p q$ we obtain \ref{eq:thm:=def-loc*}.

The following lemma is analogous to the existence of minimum point on a compact.


\begin{thm}{Lemma on almost minimum}\label{lem:alm-min}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a complete metric space,
$p\in \spc{X}$
and $r\:\spc{X}\to \RR$ be a function.
Assume that for some $\eps>0$,
the function $r$ is strictly positive in $\cBall[p,\tfrac{1}{\eps^2}\cdot r(p)]$ and
$\varliminf_{n}r(x_n)>0$ for any convergent sequence 
$x_n\to x\in \cBall[p,\tfrac{1}{\eps^2}\cdot r(p)]$. 

Then, there is a point $p^*\in \cBall[p,\tfrac{1}{\eps^2}\cdot r(p)]$ such that 

\begin{subthm}{}$r(p^*)\le r(p)$ and
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{}$r(x)> (1-\eps)\cdot r(p^*)$ 
for any $x\in \cBall[p^*,\tfrac{1}{\eps}\cdot r(p^*)]$.
\end{subthm}
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.} 
Assume the statement is wrong. 
Then for any $x\in \oBall(p,\tfrac{1}{\eps^2}\cdot r(p))$ with $r(x)\le r(p)$, there is a point $x'\in \spc{X}$ such that 
\[\dist{x}{x'}{}<\tfrac{1}\eps\cdot r(x)
\ \ \text{and}\ \ 
r(x')\le (1-\eps)\cdot r(x).\]
Take $x_0=p$ and consider a sequence of points $(x_n)$ such that $x_{n+1}=x_n'$.
Clearly 
\[\dist{x_{n+1}}{x_n}{}
\le
\tfrac{r(p)}{\eps}\cdot(1-\eps)^n
\ \ \hbox{and}\ \ 
r(x_n)\le r(p)\cdot(1-\eps)^n.\] 
In particular, $\dist{p}{x_n}{}<\tfrac{1}{\eps^2}\cdot r(p)$.
Therefore $(x_n)$ converges in itself,
$x_n\to x\in \cBall[p,\tfrac{1}{\eps^2}\cdot r(p)]$
and
$\lim_{n}r(x_n)=0$, a contradiction.
\qeds




\parit{Proof of the globalization theorem (\ref{thm:glob}).} 
Note that since for fixed points $x,y,z\in \spc{L}$, 
the function $\kappa\mapsto\angk\kappa x y z$ is continuous, 
it is sufficient to show that $\spc{L}$ is $\Alex\kappa$ 
for any $\kappa<\Kappa$.
For the rest of the proof we fix some $\kappa<\Kappa$.

Exactly the same argument as in the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:almost.geod} 
shows that $\spc{L}$ is G-delta geodesic.
By Theorem~\ref{angle-loc}, 
for any hinge $\hinge x p y$ in $\spc{L}$ the angle $\mangle\hinge x p y$ is defined 
and moreover, if $x\in \l]y z\r[$ then
\[\mangle\hinge x p y+\mangle\hinge x p z\le \pi.\] 

Let us denote by $\ComRad(p,\spc{L})$ 
(which stands for \emph{comparison radius} of $\spc{L}$ at $p$) 
the maximal value (possibly $\infty$) such that the comparison 
\[\mangle\hinge x p y
\ge\angk\kappa x p y\]
holds for any hinge $\hinge x p y$ with $\dist{p}{x}{}+\dist{x}{y}{}< \ComRad(p,\spc{L})$.

As follows from \ref{conc-loc}, $\ComRad(p,\spc{L})>0$ for any $p\in\spc{L}$ and 
$$\liminf_{n\to\infty}\ComRad(p_n,\spc{L})>0$$ 
for any converging sequence of points $p_n\to p$.
That makes it possible to apply the lemma on almost minimum (\ref{lem:alm-min}) to the function $p\mapsto \ComRad(p,\spc{L})$.

According to Short hinge lemma (\ref{lem:devel-glob}), it is sufficient  to show that 
\[s_0=\inf_{p\in\spc{L}}\ComRad(p,\spc{L})
\ge \varpi\kappa\ \ 
\text{for any}\ \ 
p\in \spc{L}.
\eqlbl{eq:thm:=def-loc-star-star}\]
We argue by contradiction, assuming that  \ref{eq:thm:=def-loc-star-star} does not hold.

The rest of the proof is easier for geodesic spaces 
and yet easier for compact spaces.
Thus we give three different arguments  for each of these cases.

\parit{End of the proof for a compact space.}
By Theorem~\ref{conc-loc} 
and compactness of $\spc{L}$, 
it's immediate that $s_0>0$.
Take a point $p^*\in \spc{L}$ such that $r^*=\ComRad(p^*,\spc{L})$ is sufficiently close to $s_0$
($p^*$ such that  $s_0\le r^*<\min\{\varpi\kappa,\tfrac32\cdot s_0\}$ will do).
Then the key lemma (\ref{key-lem:globalization}) applied for $p^*$ and $\ell$ slightly bigger than $r^*$ (say, such that $r^*<\ell<\min\{\varpi\kappa,\tfrac32\cdot s_0\}$) implies that
\[\mangle\hinge x{p^*}q
\ge\angk\kappa x{p^*}q\]
for any hinge $\hinge x{p^*}q$ such that $\dist{p^*}{x}{}+\dist{x}{q}{}<\ell$.
Thus $r^*\ge\ell$, a contradiction.

\parit{End of the proof for a geodesic space.}
Fix $\eps=0.0001$. 
Apply the lemma on almost minimum (\ref{lem:alm-min}) to find a point $p^*\in \spc{L}$ such that $r^*\z=\ComRad(p^*,\spc{L})<\varpi\kappa$ and 
\[\ComRad(q,\spc{L})\z> (1-\eps)\cdot r^*\eqlbl{comrad(q)}\] 
for any $q\in\cBall[p^*,\tfrac{1}{\eps}\cdot r^*]$. 

Applying the key lemma (\ref{key-lem:globalization}) for $p^*$ and $\ell$ slightly bigger than $r^*$ leads to a contradiction.

\parit{End of the proof, general case.}
Let us construct $p^*\in\spc{L}$ as in the previous case.
Since $\spc{L}$ is not geodesic, we can not apply the key lemma directly.
Instead, let us pass to the ultrapower $\spc{L}^\o$ which
 is a geodesic space (see \ref{cor:ulara-geod}).

According to Theorem~\ref{thm:=def-loc},
inequality \ref{comrad(q)} implies that
Condition~\ref{curv>=k} holds for some fixed $R_{\hbox{\rm\scriptsize\ref{SHORT.curv>=k}}}=\tfrac{r^*}{100}
>0$ at any point $q\in\cBall[p^*,\tfrac1{2\cdot \eps}\cdot r^*]\subset\spc{L}$.
Therefore a similar statement is true in the ultrapower $\spc{L}^\o$;
that is,
for any point
$q_\o\in\cBall[p^*,\tfrac1{2\cdot \eps}\cdot r^*]\subset\spc{L}^\o$, 
 Condition~\ref{curv>=k} holds for say $R_{\hbox{\rm\scriptsize\ref{SHORT.curv>=k}}}=\tfrac{r^*}{101}$.
In particular, $\curv_{q_\o}\spc{L}^\o\ge\kappa$ 
for any $q_\o\in\cBall[p^*,\tfrac1{2\cdot \eps}\cdot r^*]\subset\spc{L}^\o$.

Note that $r^*\ge\ComRad(p^*,\spc{L}^\o)$.
Therefore we can apply the lemma on almost minimum 
at point $p^*$ for space $\spc{L}^\o$
with function $x\mapsto\ComRad(x,\spc{L}^\o)$
and $\eps'=\sqrt\eps=0.01$.

For the obtained point $p^{{*}{*}}\in \spc{L}^\o$, we have $r^{{*}{*}}\z=\ComRad(p^{{*}{*}},\spc{L})<\varpi\kappa$ 
and 
$\ComRad(q_\o,\spc{L}^\o)\z> (1-\eps')\cdot r^{{*}{*}}$ for any $q_\o\in\cBall[p^{{*}{*}},\tfrac{1}{\eps'}\cdot r^{{*}{*}}]$. 
Thus applying the key lemma (\ref{key-lem:globalization}) for $p^{{*}{*}}$ and $\ell$ slightly bigger than $r^{{*}{*}}$ leads to a contradiction.

\section{Properties of geodesics and angles}\label{sec:prop.geod}

\parbf{Remark.} 
All proofs in this section can be easely modified to use only the local definition of $\Alex{}$ spaces without use of the globalization theorem (\ref{thm:glob}).
 
\begin{thm}{Geodesics do not split}\label{thm:g-split}
In $\Alex{}$ space, geodesics do not bifurcate.

More precisely: let $\spc{L}$ be a complete length $\Alex{}$ space and $[p x]$, $[p y]$ be two geodesics, then
\begin{subthm}{nonsplit} If  there is an $\eps>0$, such that $\geod_{[p x]}(t)=\geod_{[p y]}(t)$ 
for all $t\in[0,\eps)$, 
then $[p x]\subset [p y]$ or $[p y]\subset [p x]$.
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{angle=0}If $\mangle\hinge p x y=0$ then $[p x]\subset [p y]$ or $[p y]\subset [p x]$.
\end{subthm}
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Corollary}
Let $\spc{L}$ be a complete length $\Alex{}$ space.
Then restriction of any geodesic in $\spc{L}$ to a proper segment is the unique minimal geodesic joining its endpoints.
\end{thm}

In case $\kappa\le 0$, the proof is easier, since the model triangles are always defined.
To deal with $\kappa>0$ we have to argue locally.

\lbl[t]{19.5,-.5;$y_\eps$}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}


\parit{Proof of \ref{thm:g-split}; \ref{SHORT.nonsplit}.}
Let $t_{\max}$ be the maximal value 
such that $\geod_{[p x]}(t)=\geod_{[p y]}(t)$ for all $t\in [0,t_{\max})$.
Since geodesics are continuous $\geod_{[p x]}(t_{\max})=\geod_{[p y]}(t_{\max})$, set
\[q=\geod_{[p x]}(t_{\max})=\geod_{[p y]}(t_{\max}).\]
We have to show that $t_{\max}=\min\{\dist{p}{x}{},\dist{p}{y}{}\}$.

If that is not true, choose sufficiently small $\eps>0$ such that points
\[x_\eps=\geod_{[p x]}(t_{\max}+\eps)\ \ 
\text{and}\ \  
  y_\eps=\geod_{[p y]}(t_{\max}+\eps)\] 
are distinct.
Set
\[z_\eps=\geod_{[p x]}(t_{\max}-\eps)
=\geod_{[p y]}(t_{\max}-\eps).\]
Clearly, $\angk\kappa q{z_\eps}{x_\eps}=\angk\kappa q{z_\eps}{y_\eps}=\pi$.
Thus from (1+3)-point comparison (\ref{df:cbb1+3}), $\angk\kappa q{x_\eps}{y_\eps}=0$ and thus $x_\eps=y_\eps$, a contradiction.

\parit{(\ref{SHORT.angle=0}).} From hinge comparison \ref{angle} 
\[\mangle\hinge p x y=0\ \ \Rightarrow\ \ \angkk\kappa p{\geod_{[p x]}(t)}{\geod_{[p y]}(t)}=0\] 
and thus ${\geod_{[p x]}(t)}={\geod_{[p y]}(t)}$ for all small $t$. 
Therefore we can apply (\ref{SHORT.nonsplit}).

\begin{thm}{Adjacent angle lemma}\label{lem:sum=pi}
Let $\spc{L}$ be a complete length $\Alex{}$ space and
 $\hinge z x p$ and $\hinge z y p$ be two hinges with comon side $[zp]$ in $\spc{L}$.
Assume that points $p$, $x$, $y$ and $z$ are distinct and $z\in[xy]$,
then 
\[\mangle\hinge z p y + \mangle\hinge z p x=\pi. \]

\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
From hinge comparison (\ref{angle}) we have that both angles 
$\mangle\hinge z p y$ and $\mangle\hinge z p x$ are defined and 
\[\mangle\hinge z p y + \mangle\hinge z p x\le\pi.\]
Clearly $\mangle\hinge z x y=\pi$.
Thus, the result follows from the triangle inequality for angles (\ref{claim:angle-3angle-inq}).

\[\mangle\hinge{p_\o}{x_\o}{y_\o}

For fixed $\bar x_\o \in \l]p_\o x_\o\r]$ 
and $\bar y_\o\in \l]p_\o x_\o\r]$,
choose $\bar x_n\in \l] p x_n \r]$ and $\bar y_n\in \l] p y_n \r]$ so that $\bar x_n\to \bar x_\o$ 
and $\bar y_n\to \bar y_\o$ as $n\to\o$.
Clearly 
\[\angk\kappa{p_n}{\bar x_n}{\bar y_n}
\to 
\angk\kappa{p_\o}{\bar x_\o}{\bar y_\o}\] 
as $n\to\o$.

From the hinge comparison (\ref{angle}), $\mangle\hinge{p_n}{x_n}{y_n}\ge \angk\kappa{p_n}{\bar x_n}{\bar y_n}$.
Hence the result.

%???ADDED LATER

\begin{thm}{Angle continuity}\label{cor:ang.cont-cbb}
Let $\spc{L}_n$  be a complete length $\Alex\kappa$ space
and $\spc{L}_n\to \spc{L}_\o$ as $n\to\o$.
Assume that sequences $p_n, x_n, y_n$ in $\spc{L}_n$ 
converges correspondingly to the points $p_\o, x_\o, y_\o$ in  $\spc{L}_\o$
and the following two conditions hold
\begin{subthm}{}
$p_\o\in \Str(x_\o)$,
\end{subthm}
\begin{subthm}{}
$p_\o\in \Str(y_\o)$ or $y_\o\in \Str(p_\o)$.
\end{subthm}

Then 
\[\mangle\hinge{p_\o}{x_\o}{y_\o}
=
\lim_{n\to\o} \mangle\hinge{p_n}{x_n}{y_n}.\]

\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
By Corollary~\ref{cor:CAT>k-sence},
we may assume that $\kappa\le 0$.

By Plaut's theorem (\ref{thm:almost.geod}),
the hinge 
$\hinge{p_\o}{x_\o}{y_\o}$
is uniquely defined.
Therefore the hinges 
$\hinge{p_n}{x_n}{y_n}$
converge to  
$\hinge{p_\o}{x_\o}{y_\o}$
as $n\to\o$.
Hence by angle semicontinuity (\ref{lem:ang.semicont-cbb}), 
we get
\[
\mangle\hinge{p_\o}{x_\o}{y_\o}
\le
\lim_{n\to\o} \mangle\hinge{p_n}{x_n}{y_n}.
\]

It remains to show that 
\[
\mangle\hinge{p_\o}{x_\o}{y_\o}
\ge
\lim_{n\to\o} \mangle\hinge{p_n}{x_n}{y_n}.
\eqlbl{eq:ang-semicon->}
\]

Fix $\eps>0$.
Since $p_\o\in\Str(x_\o)$,
 there is a point $q_\o\in\spc{L}_\o$
such that 
\[\angk{\kappa}{p_\o}{x_\o}{q_\o}>\pi-\eps.\]
The hinge comparison  (\ref{angle}) implies that
\[\mangle\hinge{p_\o}{x_\o}{q_\o}>\pi-\eps.
\eqlbl{eq:>pi-eps}\]
The triangle inequality for angles
(\ref{claim:angle-3angle-inq})
\[
\begin{aligned}
\mangle\hinge{p_\o}{x_\o}{y_\o}
&\ge \mangle\hinge{p_\o}{x_\o}{q_\o}-
\mangle\hinge{p_\o}{y_\o}{q_\o}>
\\
&>\pi-\eps-
\mangle\hinge{p_\o}{y_\o}{q_\o}.
\end{aligned}
\eqlbl{eq:ang-trig}
\]

Note that we can assume in addition that $q_\o\in\Str(p_\o)$.
Choose $q_n\in\spc{L}_n$
such that $q_n\to q_\o$ as $n\to\o$.
Note that the angle semicontinuity, 
again we get
\[
\begin{aligned}
\mangle\hinge{p_\o}{x_\o}{q_\o}
&\le
\lim_{n\to\o} \mangle\hinge{p_n}{x_n}{q_n},
\\
\mangle\hinge{p_\o}{y_\o}{q_\o}
&\le
\lim_{n\to\o} \mangle\hinge{p_n}{y_n}{q_n}.
\end{aligned}
\eqlbl{eq:semicont}
\]


By (1+3)-point comparison (\ref{df:cbb1+3}) and \ref{cor:monoton:sup}, we get
\[\mangle\hinge{p_n}{x_n}{y_n}
+\mangle\hinge{p_n}{y_n}{q_n}
+\mangle\hinge{p_n}{x_n}{q_n}
\le 2\cdot\pi.\]
for all $n$.
Together with \ref{eq:semicont}, \ref{eq:>pi-eps} and \ref{eq:ang-trig}, 
it implies
\begin{align*}
\lim_{n\to\o} \mangle\hinge{p_n}{x_n}{y_n}
&\le
2\cdot\pi-\lim_{n\to\o} \mangle\hinge{p_n}{x_n}{q_n}-\lim_{n\to\o} \mangle\hinge{p_n}{y_n}{q_n}
\le 
\\
&\le 
2\cdot\pi
-\mangle\hinge{p_\o}{x_\o}{q_\o}
-\mangle\hinge{p_\o}{y_\o}{q_\o}
<
\\
&<\mangle\hinge{p_\o}{x_\o}{y_\o}+2\cdot\eps.
\end{align*}
Since $\eps>0$ is arbitrary, \ref{eq:ang-semicon->} follows.

%!!!ADDED LATER

\begin{thm}{First variation formula}\label{1st-var+}
Let $\spc{L}$ be a complete length $\Alex{}$ space.
For any point $q$ and geodesic $[px]$ in $\spc{L}$, we have 
\[\dist{q}{\geod_{[p x]}(t)}{}
=
\dist{q}{p}{}-t\cdot\cos\phi+o(t),
\eqlbl{eq:1st-var+*}\]
where $\phi$ is the infimum of angles between $[px]$ and all geodesics from $p$ to $q$ in the ultrapower $\spc{L}^\o$.
\end{thm}

\parbf{Remark.}
If $\spc{L}$ is proper space then $\spc{L}^\o=\spc{L}$, see Section~\ref{ultralimits}.
Therefore the infimum $\phi$ is achieved on some particular geodesic from $p$ to $q$.

\medskip

As a corollary we obtain the following classical result:

\begin{thm}{Strong angle lemma}\label{lem:strong-angle}
Let $\spc{L}$ be a complete length $\Alex{}$ space and $p,q\in \spc{L}$ be such that there is unique geodesic from $p$ to $q$ in the ultrapower $\spc{L}^\o$.
Then for any hinge  $\hinge  p q x$ we have
\[\mangle\hinge p q x
=
\lim_{
\substack{
\bar x\to p
\\
\bar x\in\,\l]px\r]}}\angk\kappa p q{\bar x}.\eqlbl{eq:1st-var+***}\]
for any $\kappa\in\RR$ such that $\dist{p}{q}{}<\varpi\kappa$.


In partiqular \ref{eq:1st-var+***} holds if $p\in \Str(q)$ as well as if $q\in \Str(p)$ 
\end{thm}

\parbf{Remark.}
\begin{itemize}
\item The above lemma is essentially due to Alexandrov.
The right hand side in \ref{eq:1st-var+***} is called \emph{strong angle}\index{angle!strong angle}\index{strong angle} of hinge $\hinge p q x$. 
Note that in general metric space angle and strong angle of the same hinge might differ.

\item As it follows from Exercise~\ref{ex:ultra-unique-geod}, 
if there is a unique geodesic $[p q]$ in the ultrapower $\spc{L}^\o$ then $[p q]$ lies in $\spc{L}$.
\end{itemize}



\parit{Proof lemma about strong angle (\ref{lem:strong-angle}).}
The first statement follows directly from the first variation formula (\ref{1st-var+}) 
and definition of model angle (see Section~\ref{sec:angles}).
The second statement follows from the Plaut's theorem (\ref{thm:almost.geod}) applyied to $\spc{L}^\o$.
(Note that according to Proposition~\ref{prp:A^omega} $\spc{L}^\o$ is a complete length $\Alex{}$ space.)\qeds


\parit{Proof of the first variation formula (\ref{1st-var+}).}
Let $\spc{L}$ be a complete length $\Alex{\kappa}$ space. 
Without loss of generality we can assume that $\kappa\le 0$.
The inequality 

\[\dist{q}{\geod_{[p x]}(t)}{}
\le\dist{q}{p}{}-t\cdot\cos\phi+o(t)\]
is an immediate consequence of the first variation inequality (\ref{lem:first-var}).
Thus, it is sufficient to show that
\[\dist{q}{\geod_{[p x]}(t)}{}
\ge\dist{q}{p}{}-t\cdot\cos\phi+o(t).\]
Assume the contrary, then there is $\eps>0$, such that  $\phi+\eps<\pi$
and for a sequence $t_n\to 0+$ we have
\[\dist{q}{\geod_{[p x]}(t_n)}{}
<
\dist{q}{p}{}-t_n\cdot\cos(\phi-\eps).
\eqlbl{eq:phi-eps}\]

Set $x_n=\geod_{[p x]}(t_n)$.
Clearly 
\[\angk\kappa {x_n}p q>\pi-\phi+\tfrac\eps2\]
for all large $n$.

Assume $\spc{L}$ is geodesic. 
Choose a sequence of geodesics $[x_n q]$.
Let $[x_n q]\to [pq]_{\spc{L}^\o}$  as $n\to\o$ (in general $[pq]$ might lie in $\spc{L}^\o$).
Applying both parts of hinge comparison (\ref{angle}), 
we get $\mangle\hinge {x_n}{q}{x}\z<\phi-\tfrac\eps2$  for all large $n$.
According to \ref{lem:ang.semicont-cbb}, the angle between $[pq]$ and $[px]$ is at most $\phi-\tfrac\eps2$, a contradiction.


Finally, if $\spc{L}$ is not geodesic choose a sequence $q_n\in\Str(x_n)$, such that $q_n\to q$ and the inequality 
\[\angk\kappa{x_n}{p}{q_n}\z>\pi-\phi+\tfrac\eps2\] still holds.
Then the same argument as above shows that $[x_n q_n]$ $\o$-converges to a geodesic  $[pq]_{\spc{L}^\o}$ from $p$ to $q$  having angle at most $\phi-\tfrac{\eps}{2}$ with $[px]$.

\section{On positive lower bound}\label{sec:positive.bound}

In this section we consider $\Alex{\kappa}$ spaces for $\kappa>0$.
Applying rescaling we can assume that $\kappa=1$.

The following theorem states that if one ignores a few exceptional spaces, then the diameter of a space with positive lower curvature bound is bounded.
Note that many authors (but not us) exclude these spaces in the definition of Alexandrov space with positive lower curvature bound.

\begin{thm}{On diameter of space}\label{diam-k>0}
Let $\spc{L}$ be a complete length $\Alex1$ space. 
Then either 
\begin{subthm}{} $\diam \spc{L}\le \pi$; 
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{} or $\spc{L}$ is isometric to one of the following exceptional spaces: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item real line $\RR$,
\item a ray $\RR_{\ge0}$,
\item a closed interval $[0,a]\in \RR$, $a>\pi$,
\item a circle $\SS^1_a$ of length $a>2\cdot\pi$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{subthm}
\end{thm}


\parit{Proof.} 
Assume that $\spc{L}$ is a geodesic space and $\diam \spc{L}>\pi$. 
Choose $x, y\in \spc{L}$ so that $\dist{x}{y}{}=\pi+\eps$, $0<\eps<\tfrac{\pi}{4}$. 
By moving $y$ slightly, we can also assume that geodesic $[x y]$ is unique;
to prove it, use either Plaut's theorem (\ref{thm:almost.geod}) 
or that  geodesics do not split (\ref{thm:g-split}).
Let $z$ be the midpoint of a geodesic $[x y]$.

Consider the function $f=\dist{x}{}{}+\dist{y}{}{}$.
As it follows from Lemma~\ref{concave-pi/2}, 
$f$ is concave in $\oBall(z,\tfrac{\eps}{4})$.  
Let $p\in\oBall(z,\tfrac{\eps}{4})$.  
Choose a geodesic $[z p]$. 
Set $h(t)=f\circ\geod_{[z p]}(t)$ and $\ell=\dist{z}{p}{}$.
Clearly $h$ is concave.
From Adjacent angle lemma (\ref{lem:sum=pi}), we have that $h^+(0)=0$. 
Therefore $h$ is nonincreasing which means that \[\dist{x}{p}{}+\dist{y}{p}{}
=
h(\ell)\le h(0)
=
\dist{x}{y}{}.\]  
Since the geodesic $[x y]$ is unique this means that $p\in [x y]$ and hence
 $\oBall(z,\tfrac{\eps}{4})$ only contains points of $[x y]$.
Since in $\Alex{}$ spaces, geodesics do not bifurcate (\ref{nonsplit}), 
it follows that all of $\spc{L}$ coincides with the maximal extension of $[x y]$ as a local geodesic $\gamma$ 
(which might be not minimizing).
In other words, $\spc{L}$ is isometric to a 1-dimensional Riemannian manifold with possibly non empty boundary.
From this, it is easy to see that $\spc{L}$ falls into one of the exceptional spaces described in the theorem.

Lastly, if $\spc{L}$ is not geodesic and $\diam \spc{L}>\pi$ then the above argument applied to $\spc{L}^\o$ yields that $\spc{L}^\o$ is isometric to one of the exceptional spaces. 
As all of those spaces are proper it means that $\spc{L}=\spc{L}^\o$.
\qeds

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{concave-pi/2}
Let $\spc{L}$ be a complete length $\Alex1$ space and $p\in \spc{L}$.
Then $\dist{p}{}{}\:\spc{L}\to\RR$ is concave in $\oBall(p,\pi)\backslash \oBall(p,\tfrac\pi2)$.

In particular, if $\diam\spc{L}\le\pi$ 
then the complements $\spc{L}\backslash \oBall(p,r)$ and $\spc{L}\backslash \cBall[p,r]$ are convex for any $r>\tfrac\pi2$.

\end{thm}
\parit{Proof.}
This is an immediate consequence of \ref{comp-kappa}. 
\qeds

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:fixed-point}
Let $\spc{L}$ be an $m$-dimensional complete length $\Alex1$ space and $\diam\spc{L}\le\pi$.
Assume that the group $G$ acts on  $\spc{L}$ by isometries and has closed orbits and 
\[\diam(\spc{L}/G)>\tfrac\pi2.\]
Show that the action of $G$ has a fixed point in $\spc{L}$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{On perimeter of triple}\label{perim-k>0}
Let  
$\spc{L}$ be a complete length $\Alex1$ space
and $\diam \spc{L}\le \pi$.
Then perimeter of any triple of points $p,q,r\in \spc{L}$ is at most $2\cdot\pi$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}  
Arguing by contradiction, suppose 
\[\dist{p}{q}{}+\dist{q}{r}{}+\dist{r}{p}{}> 2\cdot\pi\eqlbl{eq:perimeter-of-triange<2pi}\] 
for some $p,q,r\in \spc{L}$. 
Rescaling the space slightly, we can assume that $\diam\spc{L}<\pi$,
but the inequality \ref{eq:perimeter-of-triange<2pi} still holds.

By Corollary \ref{cor:CAT>k-sence},
after rescaling $\spc{L}$ is still $\Alex1$.

Since $\spc{L}$ is G-delta geodesic (\ref{thm:almost.geod}), it is sufficient to consider case when there is a geodesic $[q r]$. 

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{30mm}
\begin{lpic}[t(0mm),b(0mm),r(0mm),l(0mm)]{pics/spher-trig(1)}
\lbl[lt]{28,1;$\~p$}
\lbl[rb]{7,24;$\~z_0$}
\lbl[lb]{25.5,28;$\~q$}
\lbl[rt]{0.5,9;$\~r$}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

First note that since $\diam \spc{L}<\pi$, by \ref{comp-kappa} we have that the function
\[y(t)=\md1\dist[{{}}]{p}{\geod_{[q r]}(t)}{}\]
satisfies the differential inequality $y''\le 1- y$.


Take $z_0\in [q r]$ so that restriction $\dist{p}{}{}|[q r]$ attains its maximum at $z_0$, 
set $t_0=\dist{q}{z_0}{}$ so $z_0=\geod_{[q r]}(t_0)$.
Consider the following model configuration: two geodesics $[\~p\~z_0]$, $[\~q\~r]$ in $\SS^2$ such that 
\begin{align*}
\dist{\~p}{\~z_0}{}&=\dist{p}{z_0}{},
&  
\dist{\~q}{\~r}{}&=\dist{q}{r}{},
\\ 
\dist{\~z_0}{\~q}{}&=\dist{z_0}{q}{},
&  
\dist{\~z_0}{\~r}{}&=\dist{z_0}{q}{}
\end{align*}
and 
\[\mangle\hinge{\~z_0}{\~q}{\~p}
=\mangle\hinge{\~z_0}{\~r}{\~p}
=\tfrac\pi2.\]
Clearly,
$\bar y(t)=\md1\dist[{{}}]{\~p}{\geod_{[\~q\~r]}(t)}{}$ 
satisfies $\bar y''=1-\bar y$ and $\bar y'(t_0)=0$,
$\bar y(t_0)=y(t_0)$.
Since $z_0$ is a maximum point, 
$y(t)\le y(t_0)+o(t-t_0)$;
thus, $\bar y(t)$ is a barrier for 
$y(t)=\md1\dist[{{}}]{p}{\geod_{[q r]}(t)}{}$ at 
$t_0$ by \ref{barrier'}.
From barrier inequality (\ref{barrier'}), we get 
\[\dist{\~p}{\geod_{[\~q\~r]}(t)}{}
\ge 
\dist{p}{\geod_{[q r]}(t)}{},\]
thus, $\dist{\~p}{\~q}{}\ge\dist{p}{q}{}$ and $\dist{\~p}{\~r}{}\ge\dist{p}{r}{}$.

Therefore, 
$\dist{p}{q}{}+\dist{q}{r}{}+\dist{r}{p}{}$ can not exceed the perimeter of the  spherical triangle $\trig{\~p}{\~q}{\~r}$; 
that is,
\[\dist{p}{q}{}+\dist{q}{r}{}+\dist{r}{p}{}\le 2\cdot\pi,\]
a contradiction.
\qeds


Let $\kappa>0$.
Consider the following extension $\angk{\kappa+}{{*}}{{*}}{{*}}$ 
of the model angle function $\angk\kappa{{*}}{{*}}{{*}}$.
Some authors define camparison angle to be $\angk{\kappa+}{{*}}{{*}}{{*}}$ but
that leads to two different definition of model angles --- one for $\cCat{}{}$ spaces and an other for $\Alex{}$ spaces.

\begin{thm}{Definition of extended angle}
Let $p,q,r$ be points in a metric space such that  $p\not=q$, $p\not=r$ then
set
\[\angk{\kappa+} p q r=\sup\set{\angk{\Kappa} p q r}{\Kappa\le\kappa}.\]
The vlaue $\angk{\kappa+} p q r$ is called \emph{extended model angle}\index{angle!extended model angle}\index{model angle!extended model angle}\index{extended model angle} of triple $p$, $q$, $r$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Extended angle comparison}
Let $\kappa>0$ 
and $\spc{L}$ be a complete length $\Alex{}$ space. 
Then for any hinge 
$\hinge p q r$ we have 
$\mangle\hinge p q r
\ge\angk{\kappa+} p q r$.

Moreover, the extended model angle can be calculated $\angk{\kappa+} p q r$ using the following rules:

\begin{subthm}{} $\angk{\kappa+} p q r=\angk{\kappa} p q r$ once $\angk{\kappa} p q r$ is defined;
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{} $\angk{\kappa+} p q r=\angk{\kappa+} p r q=0$ if $\dist{p}{q}{}+\dist{q}{r}{}=\dist{p}{r}{}$;
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{} $\angk{\kappa+} p q r=\pi$ if none of above is applicable. 
\end{subthm}
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
From Corollary~\ref{cor:CAT>k-sence}, $\Kappa<\kappa$ implies that any complete length $\Alex{\Kappa}$ space is $\Alex{\kappa}$; 
thus the extended angle comparison follows from the definition.

The rules for calculating extended angle is an easy consequence of its definition.

\section{Remarks and open problems}

The question whether the first part of \ref{angle} suffices to conclude that $\spc{L}$ is $\Alex\kappa$ is a long standing open problem (possibly dating back to Alexandrov),
but as far as we know,  it was first formally stated in print in \cite{BBI} (see the footnote in subsection 4.1.5).


\begin{thm}{Open question}\label{open:hinge-}
Let $\spc{L}$ be a complete geodesic space (you can also assume that $\spc{L}$ is homeomorphic to $\SS^2$ or $\RR^2$) 
such that for any hinge $\hinge x p y$ in $\spc{L}$, 
the angle $\mangle\hinge x p y$ is defined and 
\[\mangle\hinge x p y\ge\angk0 x p y.\]
Is it true that $\spc{L}$ is $\Alex{0}$?
\end{thm}
