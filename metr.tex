\chapter{Metric spaces}
In this chapter we fix some conventions, assuming that the reader is familiar with basic notions in metric geometry.

\section{Metrics and their relatives}
\label{sec:metric spaces}

\parbf{Definitions.}
Let $\II$ be a subinterval of $[0,\infty]$.
A function $\rho$ defined on $\spc{X}\times\spc{X}$ is called an $\II$-valued metric if the following conditions hold;
\begin{itemize}
 \item $\rho(x,x)=0$ for any $x$;
 \item $\rho(x,y)\in \II$ for any pair $x\ne y$;
 \item $\rho(x,y)+\rho(x,z)\ge \rho(y,z)$ for any triple of points $x,y, z$.
\end{itemize}
The value $\rho(x,y)$ is also called the \index{distance}\emph{distance} between $x$ and $y$.


The above definition will be used for four choices of the interval $\II$: $(0,\infty)$, $(0,\infty]$, $[0,\infty]$ and $[0,\infty]$.
Any $\II$-valued metric can be refereed briefly as a metric;
the interval should be apparent from the context, but by default a metric is $(0,\infty)$-valued. 
If we need to be more specific, we may also use the following names:
\begin{itemize}
\item a $(0,\infty)$-valued metric may be called a \emph{genuine metric}.
\item a $(0,\infty]$-valued metric may be called an \emph{$\infty$-metric}.
\item a $[0,\infty)$-valued metric may be called  a \emph{genuine pseudommetric}.
\item A $[0,\infty]$-valued metric may be called a \emph{pseudometric} or \emph{$\infty$-pseudometric}.
\end{itemize}

A metric space is a set equipped with a metric;
the distance between points $x$ and $y$ in a metric space $\spc{X}$ will  usually be denoted by \[\dist{x}{y}{}\qquad\text{or}\quad \dist{x}{y}{\spc{X}};\]
the latter will be used if we need to emphasize that we are working in the space $\spc{X}$.

The function $\distfun{x}{}{}\:\spc{X}\to\RR$ defined as 
\[\distfun{x}{}{}\:y\mapsto\dist{x}{y}{}\]
will be called the \emph{distance function}\index{distance function} from $x$. 

Any  subset $A$ in a metric space $\spc{X}$ will be also considered as a \emph{subspace}\index{subspace};
that is, a metric space with the metric defined by restricting the metric of $\spc{X}$ to $A\times A\subset \spc{X}\times\spc{X}$.


\parbf{Zero and infinity.}
Genuine metric spaces are the main objects of study in this book.
However, the  generalizations above are useful
in  various definitions and constructions.
For example, the construction of length-metric (see Section~\ref{sec:intrinsic}) uses infinite distances.
The following definition gives another example.

\begin{thm}{Definition}\label{def:disjoint-union}
Assume $\{\spc{X}_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in\IndexSet}$ is a collection of $\infty$-metric spaces.
The disjoint union 
$$\bm{X}=\bigsqcup_{\alpha\in\IndexSet}\spc{X}_\alpha$$ 
has a natural $\infty$-metric on it defined as follows:
given two points $x\in\spc{X}_\alpha$ and $y\in\spc{X}_\beta$
set 
\[
\begin{matrix}
\dist{x}{y}{\bm{X}}=\infty&\text{if}\ \ \alpha\ne\beta,
\\
\dist{x}{y}{\bm{X}}=\dist{x}{y}{\spc{X}_\alpha}&\text{if}\ \ \alpha=\beta.
\end{matrix}
\]
The resulting $\infty$-metric space $\bm{X}$ will be called the \emph{disjoint union}\index{disjoint union of metric spaces} of $\{\spc{X}_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in\IndexSet}$, denoted by \[\bigsqcup_{\alpha\in\IndexSet}\spc{X}_\alpha.\]
\end{thm}

Now let us give examples when vanishing distance between distinct points is useful:


Suppose a set ${\spc{X}}$ comes with a set of metrics $\dist{}{}{\alpha}$ for $\alpha\in\IndexSet$.
Then 
\[\dist{x}{y}{}=\inf\set{\dist{x}{y}{\alpha}}{\alpha\in\IndexSet}.\]
is only a pseudometric;
that is, if the metrics $\dist{}{}{\alpha}$ are genuine, then $\dist{}{}{}$ has to be $[0,\infty)$-valued.

Let $\spc{X}$ be a set,
$\spc{Y}$ be a metric space and  
 $\map\:\spc{X}\to\spc{Y}$ be a map.
If $\map$ is not injective,
then the \emph{pullback}
\[\dist{x}{y}{\spc{X}}=\dist{\map(x)}{\map(y)}{\spc{Y}}\]
defines only a pseudometric on $\spc{X}$.

\parbf{Corresponding metric space and metric component.}
The following two observations show that
nearly any question about metric spaces can be reduced to a question about genuine metric spaces.

Assume $\spc{X}$ is a pseudometric space.
Set
$x\sim y$ if $\dist{x}{y}{}=0$. 
Note that if $x\sim x'$, then $\dist{y}{x}{}=\dist{y}{x'}{}$ for any $y\in\spc{X}$.
Thus, $\dist{}{}{}$ defines a metric on the
quotient set $\spc{X}/{\sim}$.
In this way we obtain a metric space $\spc{X}'$.
The space $\spc{X}'$ is called the 
\emph{corresponding metric space} for the pseudometric space $\spc{X}$.
Often we do not distinguish between $\spc{X}'$ and~$\spc{X}$. 


Set $x\approx y$ if and only if $\dist{x}{y}{}<\infty$;
this is an other equivalence relation on $\spc{X}$.
The equivalence class of a point $x\in\spc{X}$ will be called the \emph{metric component}\index{metric component} 
 of $x$; it will be denoted as $\spc{X}_x$.
One could think of $\spc{X}_x$ as  $\oBall(x,\infty)_{\spc{X}}$, the open ball centered at $x$ and radius $\infty$ in $\spc{X}$; see definition below.

It follows that any $\infty$-metric space is a \emph{disjoint union} of genuine metric spaces, the metric components of the original $\infty$-metric space; see Definition~\ref{def:disjoint-union}

To summarize this discussion: Given a $[0,\infty]$-valued metric space $\spc{X}$, we may pass to the corresponding $(0,\infty]$-valued metric space $\spc{X}'$ and break the latter  into a disjoint union of metric components, each of which is  a genuine metric space.


\section{Notations}

\parbf{Balls.}
Given $R\in[0,\infty]$ and a point $x$ in a metric space $\spc{X}$, the sets
\begin{align*}
\oBall(x,R)&=\set{y\in \spc{X}}{\dist{x}{y}{}<R},
\\
\cBall[x,R]&=\set{y\in \spc{X}}{ \dist{x}{y}{}\le R}
\end{align*}
are called respectively the  \emph{open}\index{open ball} and  the \emph{closed  balls}\index{closed ball}   of radius $R$ with center $x$.

If we need to emphasize that these balls are taken in the space $\spc{X}$,
we write 
\[\oBall(x,R)_{\spc{X}}\quad\text{and}\quad \cBall[x,R]_{\spc{X}}\]
correspondingly.

Since in a model space $\Lob{m}{\kappa}$ all balls of the same radiuses are isometric;
often will not need to specify the center of the ball,
so we may write 
\[\oBall(R)_{\Lob{m}{\kappa}}\quad\text{and}\quad\cBall[R]_{\Lob{m}{\kappa}}\] correspondingly.

A set $A\subset\spc{X}$ is called \emph{bounded}\index{bounded set} if $A\subset\oBall(x,R)$ for some $x\in\spc{X}$ and $R<\infty$.

\parbf{Distances to sets.}
For subset $A\subset \spc{X}$, 
let us denote the distance from $A$ to a point $x$ in $\spc{X}$ as $\distfun{A}{x}$;
that is,
\[\distfun{A}{x}
\df
\inf\set{\dist{a}{x}{}}{a\in A},\] 
and  %??? seems redundant as this is a special case of distances between sets. V.
we define the distance between sets $A$ and $B$  as 
\[\dist{A}{B}{}
\df
\inf\set{\dist{a}{b}{}}{a\in A,\ b\in B}.\]

For any subset $A\subset\spc{X}$,  the sets
\begin{align*}
\oBall(A,R)&=\set{y\in \spc{X}}{ \dist{A}{y}{}<R},
\\
\cBall[A,R]&=\set{y\in \spc{X}}{\dist{A}{y}{}\le R}
\end{align*}
are called respectively the  \emph{open}\index{open tubular neighborhood} and \emph{closed $R$-neighborhoods}\index{closed neighborhood} of $A$.

\parbf{Diameter, radius and packing.}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a metric space.
Then the \emph{diameter}\index{Diameter} of $\spc{X}$ is  defined as
\[\diam \spc{X}=\sup\set{\dist{x}{y}{}}{x,y\in \spc{X}}.\]

The \emph{radius}\index{Radius} of $\spc{X}$ is  defined as
\[\rad \spc{X}=\inf\set{R>0}{\oBall(x,R)= \spc{X}\ \t{for some}\ x\in\spc{X}}.\]

The packing number \emph{$\eps$-pack}\index{$\eps$-pack} of $\spc{X}$ is the maximal number  (possibly infinite) of points in $\spc{X}$ at distance $>\eps$ from each other;  it is denoted by $\pack_\eps\spc{X}$.
If $m=\pack_\eps\spc{X}<\infty$, then a set $\{x^1,x^2,\dots,x^m\}$ in $\spc{X}$ 
such that $\dist{x^i}{x^j}{}>\eps$ is called a \emph{maximal $\eps$-packing}\index{maximal $\eps$-packing} in $\spc{X}$.


\parbf{G-delta sets.}
Recall that arbitrary union of open balls in a metric space is called \index{open set}\emph{open set}.
A subset of a metric space is called G-delta set if it can be presented as an intersection of countable number of open subset. 
Often we will use the following classical result:

\begin{thm}{Baire's theorem}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a complete metric space 
and $\{\Omega_n\}$, $n\in \NN$ be a collection of open dense subsets of $\spc{X}$.
Then $\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty\Omega_n$ is dense in $\spc{X}$.
\end{thm}
 

\parbf{Proper spaces.}
A metric space $\spc{X}$ is called \emph{proper}\index{proper space} if all closed bounded sets in $\spc{X}$ are compact. 
This condition is equivalent to each of the following statements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item For some (and therefore any) point $p\in \spc{X}$ and any $R<\infty$, 
the closed ball $\cBall[p,R]\subset\spc{X}$ is compact. 
\item The function $\distfun{p}{}{}\:\spc{X}\to\RR$ is proper for some (and therefore any) point $p\in \spc{X}$.
\end{enumerate}

We will often use the following two classical statements:

\begin{thm}{Proposition}
Proper metric spaces are separable and second countable.
\end{thm}



\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{compact=seq-compact}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a metric space. Then the following are equivalent
\begin{enumerate}[i)]
\item $\spc{X}$ is compact;
\item $\spc{X}$ is \emph{sequentially compact}; that is, any sequence of points in $\spc{X}$ contains a convergent subsequence;
\item $\spc{X}$ is complete and for any $\eps>0$ there is a finite $\eps$-net in $\spc{X}$; that is, there is a finite collection of points $p_1,\ldots,p_{N}$ such that $\bigcup_i\oBall(p_i,\eps)=\spc{X}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\section{Length spaces}\label{sec:intrinsic}

\begin{thm}{Definition}\label{def:length}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a metric space.  Given a curve $\alpha\: \II\to \spc{X}$ we define its {\emph length} as 
\[
\length \alpha \df \sup_{a\le t_0\le\ldots\le t_n\le b}\left\{\sum_{i\ge 1} \dist{\alpha(t_i)}{\alpha_{i-1}}{}\right\}
\]
\end{thm}

The following lemma is an easy exercise.
%The same definition works for arbitrary map $\alpha\:\II\to \spc{X}$, not necessary continuous.

\begin{thm}{Lower semicontinuity of length}\label{thm:semicont-of-length}
Assume $\alpha_n\:\II\to \spc{X}$ is a sequence of curves that converges pointwise to a curve $\alpha_\infty\:\II\to \spc{X}$.
Then 
\[\length\alpha_\infty\le \liminf_{n\to\infty}\length\alpha_n.\]

\end{thm}

Given two points $x$ and $y$ in a metric space $\spc{X}$
consider the value
\[\yetdist{x}{y}{}=\inf_{\alpha}\{\length\alpha\},\]
where infimum is taken for all paths $\alpha$ from $x$ to $y$.

It is easy to see that $\yetdist{}{}{}$ defines a $(0,\infty]$-valued metric on  $\spc{X}$;
it will be called the \emph{length-metric}\index{length-metric} on $\spc{X}$.
Clearly 
\[\yetdist{x}{y}{}\ge \dist{x}{y}{}\]
for any $x,y\in \spc{X}$.

\begin{thm}{Definition}\label{def:length-space}
If $\yetdist{x}{y}{}=\dist{x}{y}{}$ for any pair of points $x,y$ in a metric space $\spc{X}$, then $\spc{X}$ is called a \emph{length space}\index{length space}.
\end{thm}

In other words, a metric space $\spc{X}$ is a
\emph{length space}
if for any $\eps>0$ and any two points $x,y\in \spc{X}$ with $\dist{x}{y}{}<\infty$ there is a path $\alpha\:[0,1]\to\spc{X}$ connecting%
\footnote{That is, such that $\alpha(0)=x$ and $\alpha(1)=y$.}
 $x$ to $y$
such that 
\[\length\alpha<\dist{x}{y}{}+\eps.\]

In this book, most of the time we consider length spaces.
If $\spc{X}$ is length space, 
and $A\subset \spc{X}$.
The set $A$ comes with the inherited metric from $\spc{X}$ 
which might be not a length-metric.
The corresponding length-metric on $A$ will be denoted as $\dist{}{}{A}$.

\parbf{Variations of the definition.}
We will need the following variations of Definition~\ref{def:length-space}:

\begin{itemize}
\item Assume $R>0$.
If $\yetdist{x}{y}{}=\dist{x}{y}{}$ for any pair $\dist{x}{y}{}<R$, then $\spc{X}$ is called an \emph{$R$-length space}\index{$R$-length space}.
\item If any point in $\spc{X}$ admits a neighborhood  $\Omega$ such that $\yetdist{x}{y}{}=\dist{x}{y}{}$ for any pair of points $x,y\in \Omega$
then  $\spc{X}$ is called a \emph{locally length space}\index{locally length space}.
\item A metric space $\spc{X}$ is called 
\emph{geodesic}%
\index{geodesic space}
if for any two points $x,y\in \spc{X}$ with $\dist{x}{y}{}<\infty$ there is a geodesic $[x y]$ in $\spc{X}$.
\item Assume $R>0$. A metric space $\spc{X}$ is called 
\emph{$R$-geodesic}%
\index{$R$-geodesic space}
if for any two points $x,y\in \spc{X}$ such that $\dist{x}{y}{}<R$ there is a geodesic $[x y]$ in $\spc{X}$.
\end{itemize}

Note that the notions of $\infty$-length spaces and length spaces are the same.
Clearly, any geodesic space is a length space 
and any $R$-geodesic space is $R$-length.

\begin{thm}{Example} 
Let $\spc{X}$ be obtained by gluing a countable collection of disjoint intervals $\II_n$ of length $1+\tfrac1n$ where for each $\II_n$ one end is glued to $p$ and the other to $q$.
Then $\spc{X}$ carries a natural complete length metric such that $\dist{p}{q}{}=1$, but there is no geodesic connecting $p$ to~$q$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:complete=>complete}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a metric space
and $\yetdist{}{}{}$ is the length metric on it.
Show the following
\begin{subthm}{}
If $\spc{X}$  is complete, then  $(\spc{X},\yetdist{}{}{})$ is complete.
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{}
If $\spc{X}$ is compact, then $(\spc{X},\yetdist{}{}{})$ is geodesic.
\end{subthm}
\end{thm}


\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{ex:no-geod}
Give an example of a complete length space such that no pair of distinct points can be joined by a geodesic.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Definition}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a metric space and $x,y\in\spc{X}$.

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item A point $z\in \spc{X}$ is called a \emph{midpoint} of $x$ and $y$
if 
\[\dist{x}{z}{}=\dist{y}{z}{}=\tfrac12\cdot\dist[{{}}]{x}{y}{}.\]
\item Assume $\eps\ge 0$.
A point $z\in \spc{X}$ is called \emph{$\eps$-midpoint} of $x$ and $y$
if 
\[\dist{x}{z}{},\quad\dist{y}{z}{}\le\tfrac12\cdot\dist[{{}}]{x}{y}{}+\eps.\]
\end{enumerate}

\end{thm}

Note that a $0$-midpoint is the same as a midpoint.


\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:mid>geod}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a complete metric space.

\begin{subthm}{lem:mid>length}
Assume that for any pair of points $x,y\in \spc{X}$ and any $\eps>0$
there is a $\eps$-midpoint $z$.
Then the space $\spc{X}$ is a length space.
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{lem:mid>geod:geod}
Assume that for any pair of points $x,y\in \spc{X}$ 
there is a midpoint $z$.
Then the space $\spc{X}$ is a geodesic space.
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{lem:mid>geod:R}
If for some $R>0$, the assumptions (\ref{SHORT.lem:mid>length}) or (\ref{SHORT.lem:mid>geod:geod}) hold only for pairs of points $x,y\in \spc{X}$ such that $\dist{x}{y}{}<R$, 
then the space $\spc{X}$ is a $R$-length or $R$-geodesic correspondingly.

\end{subthm}

\end{thm}


\parit{Proof.}
Fix a pair of points $x,y\in \spc{X}$.
Set $\eps_n=\frac\eps{2^{2\cdot n}}$,
$\alpha(0)=x$ and $\alpha(1)=y$.

Set $\alpha(\tfrac12)$ to be an $\eps_1$-midpoint of $\alpha(0)$ and $\alpha(1)$.
Further, set $\alpha(\frac14)$ 
and $\alpha(\frac34)$ to be $\eps_2$-midpoints 
for the pairs $(\alpha(0),\alpha(\tfrac12)$ 
and $(\alpha(\tfrac12),\alpha(1)$ respectively.
Applying the above procedure recursively,
on the $n$-th step we define $\alpha(\tfrac{\kay}{2^n})$
for every odd integer $\kay$ such that $0<\tfrac\kay{2^n}<1$, 
as an $\eps_{n}$-midpoint of the already defined
$\alpha(\tfrac{\kay-1}{2^n})$ and $\alpha(\tfrac{\kay+1}{2^n})$.


In this way we define $\alpha(t)$ for all dyadic rationals $t$ in $[0,1]$.
If $t\in[0,1]$ is not a dyadic rational, consider a sequence of dyadic rationals $t_n\to t$ as $n\to\infty$.
Note that the sequence $\alpha(t_n)$ converges;
define $\alpha(t)$ as its limit.
It is easy to see that $\alpha(t)$
does not depend on the choice of the sequence $t_n$
and $\alpha\:[0,1]\to\spc{X}$ is a path from $x$ to $y$.
Moreover,
\[\begin{aligned}
\length\alpha&\le \dist{x}{y}{}+\sum_{n=1}^\infty 2^{n-1}\cdot\eps_n\le
\\
&\le \dist{x}{y}{}+\tfrac\eps2.
\end{aligned}
\eqlbl{eq:eps-midpoint}
\]
Since $\eps>0$ is arbitrary, we get that (\ref{SHORT.lem:mid>length}).

To prove (\ref{SHORT.lem:mid>geod:geod}), 
one should repeat the same argument 
taking midpoints instead of $\eps_n$-midpoints.
In this case \ref{eq:eps-midpoint} holds for $\eps_n=\eps=0$.

The proof of (\ref{lem:mid>geod:R}) obtained by a straightforward modifications of the proofs above.
\qeds

\begin{thm}{Corollary}
A proper length space is geodesic.
\end{thm}

It follows from Lemma \ref{lem:mid>geod}, since in a compact set a sequence of $\tfrac1n$-midpoints $z_n$ contains a convergent subsequence.

\begin{thm}{Hopf--Rinow theorem}\label{thm:Hopf-Rinow}
Any complete, locally compact length space is proper.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a locally compact length space.
Given $x\in \spc{X}$, denote by $\rho(x)$ the supremum of all $R>0$ such that
the closed ball $\cBall[x,R]$ is compact.
Since $\spc{X}$ is locally compact 
$$\rho(x)>0\ \ \text{for any}\ \ x\in \spc{X}.\eqlbl{eq:rho>0}$$
It is sufficient to show that $\rho(x)=\infty$ for some (and therefore any) point $x\in \spc{X}$.

Assume the contrary; that is, $\rho(x)<\infty$.

\begin{clm}{} $B=\cBall[x,\rho(x)]$ is compact for any $x$.
\end{clm}

Indeed, $\spc{X}$ is a length space;
therefore for any $\eps>0$, 
the set $\cBall[x,\rho(x)-\eps]$ is a compact $\eps$-net in $B$.
Since $B$ is closed and hence complete, it has to be compact by Proposition~\ref{compact=seq-compact}.
\claimqeds

\begin{clm}{} $|\rho(x)-\rho(y)|\le \dist{x}{y}{\spc{X}}$,
in particular $\rho\:\spc{X}\to\RR$ is a continuous function.
\end{clm}

Indeed, assume the contrary; that is, $\rho(x)+\dist{x}{y}{}<\rho(y)$ for some $x,y\in \spc{X}$. 
Then 
$\cBall[x,\rho(x)+\eps]$ is a closed subset of $\cBall[y,\rho(y)]$ for some $\eps>0$.
Then  compactness of $\cBall[y,\rho(y)]$ implies compactness of $\cBall[x,\rho(x)+\eps]$, a contradiction.\claimqeds

Set $\eps=\min_{y\in B}\{\rho(y)\}$; 
the minimum is defined since $B$ is compact.
From \ref{eq:rho>0}, we have $\eps>0$.

Choose a finite $\tfrac\eps{10}$-net $\{a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n\}$ in $B$.
The union $W$ of the closed balls $\cBall[a_i,\eps]$ is compact.
Clearly 
$\cBall[x,\rho(x)+\frac\eps{10}]\subset W$.
Therefore $\cBall[x,\rho(x)+\frac\eps{10}]$ is compact;
a contradiction.
\qeds

\begin{thm}{Exercise}\label{exercise from BH}
Construct a geodesic space that is locally compact,
but whose completion is neither geodesic nor locally compact.
\end{thm}

\section{Convex sets}


\begin{thm}{Definition} 
\label{def:convex-set}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a geodesic space and $A\subset\spc{X}$.

We say that $A$ 
\emph{convex}%
\index{convex set}
if for every two points $p,q\in A$ any geodesic $[pq]$ lies in $A$.

We say that $A$ 
\emph{weakly convex}%
\index{convex set!weakly convex set}\index{weakly convex set}
if for every two points $p,q\in A$
there is a geodesic $[pq]$ 
that lies in $A$.

We say that $A$ is \emph{totally convex}\index{totally convex}
if for every two points $p,q\in A$, every local geodesic from $p$ to $q$ lies in $A$.

If for some $R\in (0,\infty]$ these definitions are applied only for pairs of points such that $\dist{p}{q}{}<R$ and only for the geodesics of length $<R$
then $A$ is called correspondingly 
\emph{$R$-convex},
\emph{weakly  $R$-convex}%
\index{weakly convex set!weakly $R$-convex set} 
and \emph{totally  $R$-convex}
\index{totally convex set!totally $R$-convex set}.

A set $A\subset\spc{X}$ is called 
\emph{locally convex}
if every point $a\in A$ admits an open neighborhood $\Omega\ni a$
such that for every two points $p,q\in A\cap\Omega$ every geodesic $[pq]\subset \Omega$ lies in $A$.
Similarly one defines  locally weakly convex and locally totally convex sets. %???DO we neeed all of them???
\end{thm}

\parbf{Remarks.} Let us state few observations from the definition.
\begin{itemize}
\item The notion of \emph{(weakly) convex set} is the same as \emph{(weakly) $\infty$-convex set}.
\item The inherited metric on a weakly convex set coincides with its length-metric.
\item Any open set is locally convex by definition.
\end{itemize}

The following proposition states that weak convexity survive under ulralimit.
An analogus statement about convexity does not hold;
for example there is a sequence of convex discs in $\mathbb{S}^2$ that converges to the half sphere $\mathbb{S}^2_+$, which is not convex.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:weak-convex-stable}
Let $\spc{X}_n,$ be a sequence of geodesic spaces.
Assume $A_n\subset \spc{X}_n$ be a sequence of weakly convex sets and 
$\spc{X}_n\to \spc{X}_\o$ and $A_n\to A_\o\subset \spc{X}_\o$ as $n\to\o$.
Then $A_\o$ is a weakly convex set of $\spc{X}_\o$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Fix $x_\o,y_\o\in A_\o$.
Consider the sequences $x_n,y_n\in A_n$ such that $x_n\to x_\o$ and $y_n\to y_\o$ as $n\to\o$.

Denote by $\alpha_n$ a geodesic path from $x_n$ to $y_n$ that lies in $A_n$.
Set
\[\alpha_\o(t)=\lim_{n\to \o}\alpha_n(t).\]

Note that $\alpha_\o$ is a geodesic path that lies in $A_\o$.
Hence the result follows.
\qeds






\section{Quotient spaces}\label{sec:quotient}

\parbf{Quotient spaces.} Assume $\spc{X}$ is a metric space
with an equivalence relation $\sim$.
Note that given two pseudometrics $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$ on $\spc{X}/{\sim}$
their maximum 
\[\rho(x,y)=\max\{\rho_1(x,y),\rho_2(x,y)\}\]
is also a pseudometric;
also if for these two pseudometric $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$ the projections $\spc{X}\to(\spc{X}/{\sim},\rho_i)$ are short, then so it true for $\rho(x,y)$.

It follows that 
the quotient space $\spc{X}/{\sim}$ admits natural pseudometric;
this is the maximal pseudometric on  $\spc{X}/{\sim}$ 
that makes the quotient map 
$\spc{X}\to\spc{X}/{\sim}$ to be short.
The corresponding metric space will be also denoted as $\spc{X}/{\sim}$
and will be called the \emph{quotient space}\index{quotient space} of $\spc{X}$ by the equivalence relation $\sim$.

In general case the points of the metric space $\spc{X}/{\sim}$
are formed by equivalence classes in $\spc{X}$
for a wider equivalence relation.
However, in the most of the cases we will consider, 
the set of equivalence classes will coincide with the set of points in the metric space $\spc{X}/{\sim}$.



\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:length-X}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a length space and 
$\sim$ be an equivalence relation on $\spc{X}$, then $\spc{X}/{\sim}$
is a length space.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Let $\spc{Y}$ be arbitrary metric space.
Since $\spc{X}$ is a length space,
the map $f\:\spc{X}\to \spc{Y}$ is short if and only if 
\[\length(f\circ\alpha)\le \length\alpha\]
for any curve
$\alpha\:\II\to \spc{X}$.

Denote by $\yetdist{}{}{}$ the length-metric on $\spc{Y}$.
It follows that if $f\:\spc{X}\to \spc{Y}$ is short
then so is 
$f\:\spc{X}\to (\spc{Y},\yetdist{}{}{})$.

Consider the quotient map 
$f\:\spc{X}\to\spc{X}/{\sim}$.
Recall that the space $\spc{X}/{\sim}$ is defined by the maximal pseudometric that makes $f$ to be short.

Denote by $\yetdist{}{}{}$ the length-metric on $\spc{X}/{\sim}$.
It follows that
\[f\:\spc{X}\to(\spc{X}/{\sim},\yetdist{}{}{})\]
is also short.

Note that 
\[\yetdist{x}{y}{}\ge\dist{x}{y}{\spc{X}/{\sim}}\]
for any $x,y\in \spc{X}/{\sim}$.
From maximality of $\dist{}{}{\spc{X}/{\sim}}$, we get
\[\yetdist{x}{y}{}=\dist{x}{y}{\spc{X}/{\sim}}\]
for any $x,y\in \spc{X}/{\sim}$;
that is, $\spc{X}/{\sim}$ is a length space.

\parbf{Group actions.}
Assume a group $G$ acts on a metric space $\spc{X}$.
Consider relation $\sim$ on $\spc{X}$
defined as $x\sim y$ if there is $g\in G$ such that $x=g\cdot y$.
Note that $\sim$ is an equivalence relation.

In this case the quotient space $\spc{X}/{\sim}$ will be also denoted as $\spc{X}/G$;
it could be also regarded as space of $G$-orbits in $\spc{X}$.

Assume that the group $G$ acts on $\spc{X}$ by isometries.
In this case the distance between orbits $G\cdot x$ and $G\cdot y$ in $\spc{X}/G$
can be defined directly 
\[\dist{G\cdot x}{G\cdot y}{\spc{X}/G}=\inf\set{\dist{x}{g\cdot y}{\spc{X}}
=
\dist{g^{-1}\cdot x}{y}{\spc{X}}}{g\in G}.\]

If the $G$-orbits are closed, then $\dist{G\cdot x}{G\cdot y}{\spc{X}/G}=0$ if and only if $G\cdot x=G\cdot y$.
In this case the quotient space $\spc{X}/G$ is a genuine metric space.

The following proposition follows from the definition of quotient space:

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:submetry-X/G}
Assume $\spc{X}$ is metric space and group $G$ acts on $\spc{X}$ by isometries.
Then the projection $\spc{X}\to\spc{X}/G$ is a submetry;
that is $\spc{X}\to\spc{X}/G$ is short and 1-co-Lipschitz.
\end{thm}


\section{Gluing and doubling}\label{sec:doubling}

\parbf{Gluing.}
Recall that disjoint union of metric spaces can be also considered as a metric space; see Definition~\ref{def:disjoint-union}.
Therefore the quotient-space construction works as well for an equivalence relation on a disjoint union of metric spaces.

Consider two metric spaces $\spc{X}_1$ and $\spc{X}_2$
with subset $A_1\subset\spc{X}_1$ and $A_2\subset\spc{X}_2$
and a bijection $\phi\:A_1\to A_2$.
Consider the minimal equivalence relation on $\spc{X}_1\sqcup\spc{X}_2$
such that $a\sim \phi(a)$ for any $a\in A_1$.
In this case, the corresponding quotient space 
$(\spc{X}_1\sqcup\spc{X}_2)/{\sim}$ will be called \emph{gluing}\index{gluing} of $\spc{X}$ and $\spc{Y}$ along $\phi$ and denoted as
\[\spc{X}_1\sqcup_{\phi}\spc{X}_2.\]

Note that if the map $\phi\:A_1\to A_2$ is distance preserving,
then the projections $\iota_i\:\spc{X}_i\to \spc{X}_1\sqcup_{\phi}\spc{X}_2$ are also distance preserving and 
\[\dist{\iota_1(x_1)}{\iota_2(x_2)}{\spc{X}_1\sqcup_{\phi}\spc{X}_2}
=
\inf
\set{\dist{x_1}{a_1}{\spc{X}_1}+\dist{x_2}{a_2}{\spc{X}_2}}
{ a_2=\phi(a_1)}\]
for any $x_1\in \spc{X}_1$ and $x_2\in \spc{X}_2$.

\parbf{Doubling.}
Let $\spc{V}$ be a metric space 
and $A\subset \spc{V}$ be a closed subset.
A metric space $\spc{W}$ glued from two copies of $\spc{V}$ along $A$ is called \emph{doubling of $\spc{V}$ in $A$}\index{doubling}.

The space $\spc{W}$ is completely described by the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item The space $\spc{W}$ contains $\spc{V}$ as a subspace; 
in particular the set $A$ can be treated as a subset of $\spc{W}$.
\item There is an isometric involution of $\spc{W}$ which is called \index{reflection}\emph{reflection in $A$};
further it will be denoted as $x\mapsto x'$.
\item For any $x\in \spc{W}$ we have $x\in \spc{V}$ or $x'\in \spc{V}$ and 
\[
\dist{x'}{y}{\spc{W}}
=\dist{x}{y'}{\spc{W}}
=\inf_{a\in A}\{\dist{x}{a}{\spc{V}}+\dist{a}{y}{\spc{V}}\}.
\]
for any $x,y\in \spc{V}$.
\end{itemize}




The image of $\spc{V}$ under the reflection in $A$ will be denoted by $\spc{V}'$.
The subspace $\spc{V}'$ is an isometric copy of $\spc{V}$.
Clearly $\spc{V}\cup\spc{V}'=\spc{W}$ and $\spc{V}\cap\spc{V}'=A$.
Moreover $a=a'$ $\iff$ $a\in A$.

The following proposition follows directly from the definitions.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:doubling}
Assume $\spc{W}$ is the doubling of metric space $\spc{V}$ in its closed subset $A$.
Then 

\begin{subthm}{}
If $\spc{V}$ is a complete length space, then so is $\spc{W}$.
\end{subthm}
 
\begin{subthm}{}
If $\spc{V}$ is proper, then so is $\spc{W}$.
In this case, for any $x,y\in\spc{V}$ there is $a\in A$ such that 
\[\dist{x}{a}{\spc{V}}+\dist{a}{y}{\spc{V}}=\dist{x}{y'}{\spc{W}}.\]
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{prop:doubling:projection}
Given $x\in \spc{W}$ set $\bar x=x$ if $x\in \spc{V}$
and $\bar x=x'$ otherwise. The map $\spc{W}\to\spc{V}$ defined by $x\mapsto \bar x$ is short and length-preserving.
In particular if $\gamma$ is a geodesic in $\spc{W}$ with ends in $\spc{V}$, then $\bar\gamma$ is a geodesic in $\spc{V}$ with the same ends.
\end{subthm}
\end{thm}



\section{Kuratowsky embedding}

Given a metric space $\spc{X}$, 
let us denote by $\Bnd(\spc{X},\RR)$ the space of all bounded functions on $\spc{X}$ equipped with the sup-norm,
\[\|f\|=\sup_{x\in\spc{X}}\{|f(x)|\}.\]

\parbf{Kuratowski embedding.}
Given a point $p\in\spc{X}$, consider 
map $\kur_p\:\spc{X}\to\Bnd(\spc{X},\RR)$, 
defined as $\kur_p x=\distfun{x}{}{}-\distfun{p}{}{}$.
The map $\kur_p$ will be called \emph{Kuratowski map at $p$}%
\index{Kuratowski map}.

From the triangle inequality, we have
\[\|\kur_p x-\kur_p y\|
=
\sup_{z\in\spc{X}}\{|\dist{x}{z}{}-\dist{y}{z}{}|\}
=
\dist{x}{y}{}.\]
Therefore, for any $p\in\spc{X}$, the Kuratowski map gives a distance preserving map $\kur_p\:\spc{X}\hookrightarrow\Bnd(\spc{X},\RR)$.
Thus, we can (and often will) consider space $\spc{X}$ as a subset of  $\Bnd(\spc{X},\RR)$.
