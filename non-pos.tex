\section{Line strip theorem}

\begin{thm}{Line strip theorem}\label{split=<0}
Let $\spc{U}$ be a complete length $\CAT0$ space and $\ell???$ be a line in $\spc{U}$.
Let $\spc{U}_\ell$ denotes the subset of all points in $\spc{U}$ for which sum of two Busemann functions ??? is equlal $0$.
Then $\spc{U}_\ell$ is a closed convex subset of $\spc{U}$ and it admits an isometric splitting $\spc{U}_\ell=\ell^\perp\oplus\ell$
\end{thm}
