\chapter{Convergence of metric spaces}

In this section we discuss the
Gromov--Hausdorff convergence of metric spaces.

%It seems that 
To the best of our knowledge Hausdorff convergence of subsets of a fixed metric space was first introduced by Felix Hausdorff \cite{hausdorff}
and a couple of years later an equivalent definition was given by Wilhelm Blaschke \cite{blaschke}.
A further refinement of this definition was introduced by Zdeněk Frolík \cite{frolik}
and then rediscovered by Robert Wijsman \cite{wijsman},
however this refinement was a step in the direction of the so-called {}\emph{closed convergence} introduced by Hausdorff in the original book. 
For that reason we call it Hausdorff convergence
instead of
\emph{Hausdorff--Blascke--Frol\'{\i}k--Wijsman convergence}.

Gromov--Hausdorff convergence was first introduced by David Edwards \cite{edwards}
and rediscovered later by Mikhael Gromov \cite{gromov-polynomial-growth}.
It was an essential tool in Gromov's proof that any group of polynomial growth has  a nilpotent subgroup of finite index.
Other versions of convergence of metric spaces
were considered earlier, but each time
the definition was limited to very specific types of problems.

The definition of Gromov--Hausdorff convergence or metric spaces uses 
the notion of Hausdorff convergence.
It means that a sequence of metric spaces admits a sequence of distance preserving embedding into a common ambient metric space such that the their
images converge in the Hausdorff sense.
Our definition of the Gromov--Hausdorff convergence is slightly different from the standard. %V: What does that mean???A:fixed???

\section{Convergence of subsets}

Let $\spc{X}$ be a metric space and $A\subset \spc{X}$.
We will denote by $\distfun Ax$ the distance from $A$ to a point $x$ in $\spc{X}$;
that is,
$$\distfun Ax\df\inf\set{\dist{a}{x}{}}{a\in A}.$$

\begin{thm}{Definition of Hausdorff convergence}\label{def:hausdorff-coverge}
Given a sequence of nonempty closed sets $(A_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ in a nonempty metric space $\spc{X}$ 
a closed set $A_\infty\subset \spc{X}$ is called the Hausdorff limit of $(A_n)_{n=1}^\infty$,
briefly $A_n\Hto A_\infty$ if 
$$\distfun{A_n}x\to\distfun{A_\infty}x\quad \text{as}\quad n\to\infty$$
for any fixed $x\in \spc{X}$.

In this case the sequence of closed sets $(A_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ is called {}\emph{converging} or \index{Hausdorff convergence}\emph{converging in the sense of Hausdorff}.
\end{thm}

%One can extend the definition slightly.
%It is natural to assume that $\dist{\emptyset}{x}{}=\infty$ for every $x$.
%Therefore if $\dist_{A_n}(x)\to\infty$ for some (and therefore any) $x\in \spc{X}$, then we can assume that the Hausdorff limit of $A_n$ is the empty set.
%Using this definition we can remove the condition 




\begin{thm}{Selection theorem}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a proper metric  space
and $(A_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ be a sequence of closed sets in $\spc{X}$.
Assume that for some (and therefore any) point  $x\in\spc{X}$ 
the sequence $\distfun{A_n}x$ is bounded.
Then  $(A_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ has a converging subsequence in the sense of Hausdorff.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Since $\spc{X}$ is proper,
we can choose a countable dense set $\{x_1,x_2, \dots\}$ in $\spc{X}$.
Note that the sequence $a_n=\distfun{A_n}x_\kay$ is bounded for each $\kay$. 
Therefore, passing to a subsequence of $(A_n)_{n=1}^\infty$,
we can assume that $\distfun{A_n}x_\kay$ is converging as $n\to\infty$ for any fixed $\kay$.

Note that for each $n$, the function $\distfun{A_n}\:\spc{X}\to\RR$ is 1-Lipschitz and nonnegative.
Therefore the sequence $\distfun{A_n}$ converges pointwise to a 1-Lipschitz nonnegative function $f\:\spc{X}\to\RR$.

Set $A_\infty=f^{-1}(0)$.
Since $f$ is 1-Lipschitz, 
$\distfun{A_\infty}y\ge f(y)$ for any $y\in \spc{X}$.
It remains to show that $\distfun{A_\infty}y\le f(y)$ for any $y$.

Assume the  contrary;
that is, $f(z)<R<\distfun{A_\infty}z$ for some $z\in \spc{X}$ and $R>0$.
Then for any sufficiently large $n$ there is a point $z_n\in A_n$ such that
$\dist{x}{z_n}{}\le R$.
Since $\spc{X}$ is proper, we can pass to a partial limit $z_\infty$ of $z_n$ as $n\to\infty$.

Clearly that $f(z_\infty)=0$; that is, $z_\infty\in A_\infty$.
On the other hand, 
\[\distfun{A_\infty}y\le\dist{z_\infty}{y}{}\le R<\distfun{A_\infty}y,\] 
a contradiction.

\section{Convergence of spaces}

\begin{thm}{Definition}\label{def:comp-metr}
Let $\set{\spc{X}_\alpha}{\alpha\in\IndexSet}$ be a set of metric spaces.
A metric space $\bm{X}$
is called a \index{common space}\emph{common space} of $\set{\spc{X}_\alpha}{\alpha\in\IndexSet}$ if its underlying set is formed by the disjoint union $$\bigsqcup_{\alpha\in\IndexSet} \spc{X}_\alpha$$ 
and each inclusion $\iota_\alpha\:\spc{X}_\alpha\hookrightarrow\bm{X}$
is distance preserving.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Definition}\label{def:GH}
Let $\bm{X}$ be a common space for a proper metric spaces
$\spc{X}_1,\spc{X}_2,\dots$ and $\spc{X}_\infty$.
Assume that $\spc{X}_n$ forms an open set in $\bm{X}$ for each $n<\infty$ and 
$\spc{X}_n\Hto \spc{X}_\infty$ in $\bm{X}$ as $n\to\infty$.

In this case the topology $\GH$ of $\bm{X}$ is called a \index{Gromov--Hausdorff convergence}\emph{Gromov--Hausdorff convergence}
and we write $\spc{X}_n\GHto \spc{X}_\infty$ or $\spc{X}_n\xGHto{\GH} \spc{X}_\infty$;
the later notation is used if we need to consider  the specific Gromov--Hausdorff convergene $\GH$.
The space $\spc{X}_\infty$ is called the limit space of the sequence $(\spc{X}_n)$ along $\GH$.
\end{thm}

Once we write $\spc{X}_n\GHto \spc{X}_\infty$ we mean that we made a choice of a Gromov--Hausdorff convergence.

Note that for a fixed sequence of metric spaces $\spc{X}_1,\spc{X}_2,\dots$ one may construct different Gromov--Hausdorff convergences, say $\spc{X}_n\xGHto{\GH} \spc{X}_\infty$ and $\spc{X}_n\xGHto{\GH'} \spc{X}_\infty'$  and their limit spaces $\spc{X}_\infty$ and $\spc{X}_\infty'$ need not be isometric to each other. 
For example, for the constant sequence $\spc{X}_n\iso\RR_{\ge0}$, 
one may take $\spc{X}_\infty\iso\RR_{\ge0}$.
In this case a point in the disjont space $\bm{X}$ can be thought as a pair $(x,n)\in \RR_{\ge}\times (\ZZ_>\cup \{\infty\})$ 
and the metric on $\bm{X}$ can be defined as: 
$$\dist{(x,n)}{(y,m)}{\bm{X}}\df|\tfrac1n-\tfrac1m|+|x-y|,$$
where we assume that $0=\tfrac1\infty$.
On the other hand, one can take $\spc{X}_\infty'\iso\RR$,
and consider the metric
\begin{align*}
\dist{(x,n)}{(y,m)}{\bm{X}'}
&=|\tfrac1n-\tfrac1m|+|(x-n)-(y-m)|,
\\
\dist{(x,n)}{(y,\infty)}{\bm{X}'}
&=\tfrac1n+|(x-n)-y|,
\\
\dist{(x,\infty)}{(y,\infty)}{\bm{X}'}
&=|x-y|.
\end{align*}
where $n, m<\infty$.

\begin{thm}{Induced convergences}
Assume $\spc{X}_n\xGHto{\GH}\spc{X}_\infty$,
and $\bm{X}$ as in the definition \ref{def:GH}
and $\iota_n\:\spc{X}_n\hookrightarrow\bm{X}$, $\iota_\infty\:\spc{X}_\infty\hookrightarrow\bm{X}$ are the corresponding inclusions.

\begin{subthm}{}
A sequence of points $x_n\in\spc{X}_n$ converges to $x_\infty\in\spc{X}_\infty$ (briefly, $x_n\to x_\infty$ or $x_n\xto{\GH} x_\infty$) 
if $\dist{x_n}{x_\infty}{\bm{X}}\to 0$.
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{}
A sequence of closed sets 
$\mathfrak{C}_n\subset \spc{X}_n$ 
converges to a closed  set 
$\mathfrak{C}_\infty\subset \spc{X}_\infty$ (briefly, $\mathfrak{C}_n\to \mathfrak{C}_\infty$ or $\mathfrak{C}_n\xto{\GH} \mathfrak{C}_\infty$)
if $\mathfrak{C}_n\Hto\mathfrak{C}_\infty$ as subsets of $\bm{X}$.
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{}
A sequence of open sets $\Omega_n\subset \spc{X}_n$ 
converges to an open set $\Omega_\infty\subset \spc{X}_\infty$
(briefly, $\Omega_n\to \Omega_\infty$ 
or $\Omega_n\xto{\GH} \Omega_\infty$)
if the complements $\spc{X}_n\backslash \Omega_n$ converge to the complement $\spc{X}_\infty\backslash \Omega_\infty$ as closed sets. %what if the limit is everything???
\end{subthm}


\begin{subthm}{} Let $\spc{X}_n\xGHto{\GH} \spc{X}_\infty$ and $\spc{Y}_n\xGHto{\theta} \spc{Y}_\infty$. 
A sequence of submaps (see section \ref{sec:submaps}) $\map_n\:\spc{X}_n\subto \spc{Y}_n$ converges to a submap $\map_\infty\:\spc{X}_\infty\subto \spc{Y}_\infty$ if the following conditions holds
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Dom\map_n\to \Dom\map_\infty$ as a sequence of open sets.

\item For any $x_\infty\in \Dom \map_\infty$ and any sequence $x_n\in \spc{X}_n$ such that $x_n\to x_\infty$
\[\spc{Y}_n\ni \map _n(x_n)\xto\theta \map_\infty(x_\infty)\in\spc{Y}_\infty\] 
as $n\to\infty$.
\end{itemize}
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{} Given a sequence of measures $\mu_n$ on $\spc{X}_n$
denote by $\iota_n\#\mu_n$ the pushforward measures on $\bm{X}$. %V: I would suggest using the notation ${\iota_n}_\#\mu_n$ , i.e. making $\#$  a subindex. That's a much more standard notation for pushforward. %A: in this case we get double index --- I do not like it. We may remove pushforward completely.
We say that $(\mu_n)$ weakly converges to a measure $\mu_\infty$ on $\spc{X}_\infty$ 
(brefly, $\mu_n\xto{}
\mu_\infty$ or $\mu_n\xto{\GH}
\mu_\infty$) 
if the pushforward measures $\iota_n\#\mu_n$ weakly converge to the $\iota_\infty\#\mu_\infty$.

In other words, 
if for any continuous function $\phi\:\bm{X}\to\RR$ with a compact support, we have 
\[\int\limits_{\spc{X}_n} \phi\circ\iota_n(x)
\cdot
\dd_x\mu_n
\to 
\int\limits_{\spc{X}_\infty} \phi\circ\iota_\infty(x)
\cdot\dd_x\mu_\infty\]
as $n\to\infty$.
\end{subthm}
\end{thm}

\parbf{Liftings.}
Given a Gromov--Hausdorff convergence 
$\spc{X}_n\GHto \spc{X}_\infty$
and a point $p_\infty\in\spc{X}_\infty$ any sequence of points $p_n\in\spc{X}_n$ such that $p_n\GHto p$  will be called a \index{lifting of a point}\emph{lifting} of $p_\infty$.
In this case the point $p_n\in \spc{X}_n$ will be called a lifting of $p_\infty$ in $\spc{X}_n$.
We will also say that $\distfun{p_n}{}{}\:\spc{X}_n\to \RR$ 
is a \index{lifting of a distance function}\emph{lifting} 
of the distance function $\distfun{p}{}{}\:\spc{X}\to \RR$.
Obviously $\distfun{p_n}{}{}\GHto\distfun{p}{}{}$.

Note that liftings are not uniquely defined.
We will be interested in the properties of liftings for sufficiently large $n$.

In the same way we can talk about liftings of a point array
$\bm{p}_\infty\z =(p_\infty^1,p_\infty^2,\dots,p_\infty^\kay)$ in $\spc{X}_\infty$
and of the corresponding distance map 
$\distfun{\bm{p}_\infty}{}{}\:\spc{X}_\infty\to\RR^\kay$
$$\distfun{\bm{p}_\infty}{}{}\:x\mapsto(\dist{p_\infty^1}{x}{},\dist{p_\infty^2}{x}{},\dots,\dist{p_\infty^k}{x}{})$$

\section{Gromov's selection theorem}

\begin{thm}{Gromov's selection theorem}\label{thm:gromov-selection}
Let $\spc{X}_n$ be a sequence of proper metric spaces 
with marked points $x_n\in \spc{X}_n$.
Assume that for any fixed $R,\eps>0$ there is $N=N(R,\eps)\in\ZZ_{>0}$ 
such that for each $n$
the ball $\cBall[x_n,R]\subset \spc{X}_n$ admits a finite $\eps$-net with at most $N$ points.
Then there is a subsequence of $\spc{X}_n$ that admits a Gromov--Hausdorff convergence 
such that the sequence of marked points $x_n\in\spc{X}_n$ (sub)converges.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
By the main assumption of the theorem, there is a sequence of integers $M_1<M_2<\dots$
such that in each space $\spc{X}_n$
there is a sequence of points $z_{i,n}\in\spc{X}_n$ such that
\[\dist{z_{i,n}}{x_n}{\spc{X}_n}\le \kay+1\quad \text{if}\quad i\le M_\kay\]
and
the points $z_{1,n},\dots,z_{M_\kay,n}$ form an $\tfrac1\kay$-net in $\cBall[x_n,\kay]_{\spc{X}_n}$.

Passing to a subsequence, we can assume that the sequence \[\ell_n=\dist{z_{i,n}}{z_{j,n}}{\spc{X}_n}\] 
converges for any $i$ and $j$.

Let us consider countable set of points $\spc{W}=\{w_1,w_2,\dots\}$
equipped with the pseudometric defined as 
\[\dist{w_i}{w_j}{\spc{W}}
=
\lim_{n\to\infty}\dist{z_{i,n}}{z_{j,n}}{\spc{X}_n}.\]
Let $\hat{\spc{W}}$ be the metric space corresponding to $\spc{W}$.
Denote by
$\spc{X}_\infty$ the completion of $\hat{\spc{W}}$.

It remains to show that there is a Gromov--Hausdorff convergence 
$\spc{X}_n\GHto\spc{X}_\infty$ such that the sequence $x_n\in\spc{X}_n$ converges.
To prove this, we need to construct a metric on the disjoint union of \[\bm{X}=\spc{X}_\infty\sqcup\spc{X}_1\sqcup\spc{X}_2\sqcup\dots\] 
satisfying definitions \ref{def:comp-metr} and \ref{def:GH}.

Such a  metric can be defined as follows.
Fix a sequence $\eps_\kay\to0+$
and let $N_\kay$ be the minimal integer such that
\[\left|\dist{w_i}{w_j}{\spc{W}}
-
\dist{z_{i,n}}{z_{j,n}}{\spc{X}_n}\right|<\eps_\kay
\]
if $i,j\le N_\kay$ and $n\ge N_\kay$. 
Let us equip $\bm{X}$ with the maximal metric such that all the inclusions $\iota_n\:\spc{X}_n\to\bm X$  and $\iota_\infty\:\spc{X}_\infty\to\bm X$ are isometric and 

\[
\dist{z_{i,n}}{w_i}{}\le \eps_\kay
\]
for $i\le N_\kay, n\ge N_\kay$. It's easy to verify  that such metric on $\bm X$ satisfies  \ref{def:comp-metr} and \ref{def:GH}.

%Set
%\[\dist{x}{y}{\bm{X}}=
%\begin{cases}
%\dist{x}{y}{\spc{X}_n}& x,y\in \spc{X}_n
%\\
%\dist{x}{y}{\spc{X}_\infty}& x,y\in \spc{X}_\infty
%\end{cases}
%\]

%Set,
%\[
%\delta(z_{i,n},z_{i,\infty})
%=
%\sup\set{\left|\dist{z_{i,m}}{z_{j,m}}{\spc{X}_m}
%-
%\dist{z_{i,\infty}}{z_{j,\infty}}{\spc{X}_\infty}\right|}
%{j\le i,\, m\ge n}.\]
%Let us equip $\bm{X}$ with the maximal metric such that each inclusion $\iota_n\:\spc{X}_n\to X$ 
%is short 
%and the $\dist{z_{i,n}}{z_{i,\infty}}{\bm{X}}\le \delta(z_{i,n},z_{i,\infty})$ for any $i$ and $n$.
%In other words, let us define

\section{Convergence of compact spaces.}

\begin{thm}{Definition}
Let $\spc{X}$ and $\spc{Y}$ be metric spaces. A map $f\:\spc{X}\to\spc{Y}$
is called an \index{isometry!$\eps$-siometry}\emph{$\eps$-isometry}
if the following two conditions hold:
\begin{subthm}{}
$\Im f$ is an $\eps$-net in $\spc{Y}$.
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{}
$|\dist{f(x)}{f(x')}{\spc{Y}}-\dist{x}{x'}{\spc{X}}|\le \eps$ for any $x,x'\in\spc{X}$.
%$\dist{f(x)}{f(x')}{\spc{Y}}\lege\dist{x}{x'}{\spc{X}}\pm\eps$ for any $x,x'\in\spc{X}$. %V: the notation $\lege$ is not really standard. It should be defined if introduced but it might be easier just not to use it. %A: agree --- I use it often, but in this book it appers 2 times only.
\end{subthm}

\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:almost-isom}
Let $\spc{X}_1,\spc{X}_2,\dots$ and $\spc{X}_\infty$ be metric spaces and $\eps_n\to\0+$ as $n\to\infty$.
Suppose that either 

\begin{subthm}{}\label{lem:almost-isom-a}
for each $n$ there is an $\eps_n$-isometry $f_n\:\spc{X}_n\to\spc{X}_\infty$, or
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{}\label{lem:almost-isom-b}
for each $n$ there is an $\eps_n$-isometry $h_n\:\spc{X}_\infty\to\spc{X}_n$.
\end{subthm}

Then there is a Gromov--Hausdorff convergence $\spc{X}_n\GHto \spc{X}_\infty$.
\end{thm}


\parit{Proof.}
To prove part \eqref{lem:almost-isom-a}  let us construct a common space $\bm{X}$ for the spaces $\spc{X}_1,\spc{X}_2,\dots$ and $\spc{X}_\infty$
by taking the metric $\rho$ on the disjoint union $\spc{X}_\infty\sqcup\spc{X}_1\sqcup\spc{X}_2\sqcup\dots$ that is defined the following way:
\begin{align*}
\rho(x_n,y_n)&=\dist{x_n}{y_n}{\spc{X}_n},\quad \rho(x_\infty,y_\infty)=\dist{x_\infty}{y_\infty}{\spc{X}_\infty},
\\
\rho(x_n,x_\infty)&=\inf\set{\dist{x_n}{y_n}{\spc{X}_n}+\eps_n+\dist{x_\infty}{f(y_n)}{\spc{X}_\infty}}{{y_n}\in \spc{X}_n},
\\
\rho(x_n,x_m)&=\inf\set{\rho(x_n,y_\infty)+\rho(x_m,y_\infty)}{y_\infty\in\spc{X}_\infty},
\end{align*}
where we assume that $x_m\in \spc{X}_m$, $x_n\in \spc{X}_n$, and $x_\infty\in \spc{X}_\infty$. 

It remains to observe that $\rho$ is indeed a metric and 
$\spc{X}_n\Hto \spc{X}_\infty$ in~$\bm{X}$.

The proof of the second part is analogous; one only needs to change one line in the definition of $\rho$ to the following:
\[\rho(x_n,x_\infty)=\inf\set{\dist{x_n}{h(y_\infty)}{\spc{X}_n}+\eps_n+\dist{x_\infty}{y_\infty}{\spc{X}_\infty}}{{y_\infty}\in \spc{X}_\infty}.\]
\qedsf

\begin{thm}{Definition}
 Given two compact spaces $\spc{X}$ and $\spc{Y}$, we will write 
\begin{itemize}
\item $\spc{X}\le \spc{Y}$ if there is a non-contracting map $\map\:\spc{X}\to \spc{Y}$.
\item $\spc{X}\le \spc{Y}+\eps$ if there is a map $\map\:\spc{X}\to \spc{Y}$ such that for any $x,x'\in \spc{X}$ we have
\[\dist{x}{x'}{}\le \dist{\map(x)}{\map(x')}{}+\eps.\]
\end{itemize}

\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:>=-isometry}
Let $\spc{X}$ and $\spc{Y}$ be two metric spaces and $\spc{X}$ is compact, then
\[
\spc{X}\ge\spc{Y}\ge\spc{X}
\quad \iff\quad 
\spc{X}\iso\spc{Y}.
\]

\end{thm}

The following proof was suggested by Travis Morrison.

\parit{Proof.}
Let $f\: \spc{X} \to \spc{Y}$ 
and $g\: \spc{Y} \to \spc{X}$ be non contracting mappings.
It is sufficient to prove that $h  = g\circ f\:\spc{X}\to \spc{X}$ is an isometry. 

Given any pair of points $x,y\in \spc{X}$, 
set $x_n\z=h^{\circ n}(x)$ and $y_n\z=h^{\circ n}(y)$.
Since $\spc{X}$ is compact, one can choose an increasing sequence of integers $n_\kay$
such that both sequences $(x_{n_i})_{i=1}^\infty$ and $(y_{n_i})_{i=1}^\infty$
converge.
In particular, both of these sequences  are converging in itself;
that is,
\[
\dist{x_{n_i}}{x_{n_j}}{},\dist{y_{n_i}}{y_{n_j}}{}\to 0
\]
as $\min\{i,j\}\to\infty$.
Since $h$ is non-contracting, we get
\[
\dist{x}{x_{|n_i-n_j|}}{}\le \dist{x_{n_i}}{x_{n_j}}{}.
\]
It follows that  
there is a sequence $m_i\to\infty$ such that
\[
x_{m_i}\to x\quad \text{and}\quad y_{m_i}\to y\quad \text{as}\quad \kay\to\infty.
\eqlbl{eq:x_l->x}
\]

Let $\ell_n=\dist{x_n}{y_n}{}$.
Since $h$ is noncontracting, $(\ell_n)$ is a nondecreasing sequence.
On the other hand, 
from \ref{eq:x_l->x}, it follows that $\ell_{m_i}\to\dist{x}{y}{}=\ell_0$ as $m_i\to\infty$;
that is, $(\ell_n)$ is a constant sequece.
In particular $\ell_0=\ell_1$ for any $x$ and $y\in \spc{X}$;
that is, $h$ is distance preserving map.

Therefore $h(X)$ is isometric to $\spc{X}$.
From \ref{eq:x_l->x}, we get that $h(\spc{X})$ is everywhere dense.
Since $X$ is compact, we get that $h(\spc{X})=\spc{X}$.

The \index{Gromov--Hausdorff distance}\emph{Gromov--Hausdorff distance} between isometry classes of compact metric spaces $\spc{X}$ and $\spc{Y}$, is defined by
\[\GHdist(\spc{X},\spc{Y})
\df
\inf\set{\eps>0}{\spc{X}\le \spc{Y}+\eps\ \text{and}\ \spc{Y}\le \spc{X}+\eps}.
\]
The Gromov--Hausdorff distance turns the set of all isometry classes of compact metric spaces into a metric space.
The following theorem shows that convergence in this space coinsides with the Gromov--Hausdorff convergence defined above.

\begin{thm}{Theorem} Let $\spc{X}_1,\spc{X}_2,\dots$ and $\spc{X}_\infty$ be compact metric spaces.
Then there is a convergence $\spc{X}_n\GHto \spc{X}_\infty$ if and only if
$\GHdist(\spc{X}_n,\spc{X}_\infty)\to 0$ as $n\to\infty$.

\end{thm}

\parit{Proof; if part.}
Suppose $a_n\:\spc{X}_\infty\to \spc{X}_n$
and $b_n\:\spc{X}_n\to \spc{X}_\infty$ are sequences of maps such that
\[\dist{a_n(x)}{a_n(y)}{\spc{X}_\infty}
\ge
\dist{x}{y}{\spc{X}_n}-\delta_n,\]
\[\dist{b_n(v)}{b_n(w)}{\spc{X}_n}
\ge
\dist{v}{w}{\spc{X}_\infty}-\delta_n\]
for any $x,y\in \spc{X}_n$ and $v,w\in\spc{X}_\infty$ and some sequence $\delta_n\to0+$.
Let us show that $\spc{X}_n\xto{\GH}\spc{X}_\infty$. 

Fix $\eps>0$ and choose a maximal $\eps$-packing $\{x^1,x^2,\dots,x^\kay\}$ in $\spc{X}_\infty$ such that the value $\sum_{i<j}\dist{x^i}{x^j}{}$ is maximal.
Note that 
\[\dist{a_n\circ b_n(x^i)}{a_n\circ b_n(x^j)}{}\ge\dist{x^i}{x^j}{}-2\cdot\delta_n.\]
Since the value $\sum_{i<j}\dist{x^i}{x^j}{}$ is maximal, 
\[\dist{a_n\circ b_n(x^i)}{a_n\circ b_n(x^j)}{}\to\dist{x^i}{x^j}{}\]
for all $i$ and $j$ as $n\to\infty$.
For all large $n$,
we have $2\cdot\delta_n<\dist{x^i}{x^j}{}-\eps$;
thus 
\[\dist{b_n(x^i)}{b_n(x^j)}{\spc{X}_n}>\eps
\quad\text{and}\quad\dist{a_n\circ b_n(x^i)}{a_n\circ b_n(x^j)}{\spc{X}_n}>\eps\] 
for all $i\not=j$.
Therefore for each large $n$, 
the set $\{a_n\circ b_n(x^i)\}$ forms a maximal $\eps$-packing and therefore an $\eps$-net in $\spc{X}_\infty$.

Since $\{a_n\circ b_n(x^i)\}$ is an  $\eps$-net in $\spc{X}_\infty$,
for any $y_n\in\spc{X}_n$, there is $x^i$ such that $\dist{a_n\circ b_n(x^i)}{a_n(y_n)}{}<\eps$.
Thus, $\dist{b_n(x^i)}{y_n}{}<\eps+\delta_n$;
that is, $\{b_n(x^i)\}$ is a $(\eps+\delta_n)$-net in $\spc{X}_n$.

Given $y\in \spc{X}_n$ choose $x^i$ so that $\dist{b_n(x^i)}{y_n}{}<\eps+\delta_n$ and define $h_n(y)=a_n\circ b_n(x^i)$.
Observe that $h_n$ is a $3\cdot\eps$-isometry for all large $n$.
Since $\eps>0$ is arbitrary, there is a sequence of $\eps_n$-isometries $\spc{X}_n\to\spc{X}_\infty$ such that $\eps_n\to\0+$ as $n\to\infty$.
It remains to apply \ref{lem:almost-isom}.

\parit{Only-if part.}
Assume $\spc{X}_n\xto{\GH}\spc{X}_\infty$.
Fix $\eps>0$ and choose a maximal $\eps$-packing $\{x^1,x^2,\dots,x^\kay\}$ in $\spc{X}_\infty$.
For each $x^i$, 
choose a sequence $x^i_n\in\spc{X}_n$ such that $a_n(x^i_n)\to x^i$.
Note that for all large $n$, we have $\dist{x^i_n}{x^j_n}{}>\eps$.
For each point $z\in \spc{X}_\infty$, choose $x^i$ so that $\dist{z}{x^i}{}<\eps$ and define map $b_n\:\spc{X}_\infty\to\spc{X}_n$ such that 
$b_n(z)=x^i_n$.
Observe that 
\[\dist{b_n(y)}{b_n(z)}{\spc{X}_n}+3\cdot\eps>\dist{y}{z}{\spc{X}_\infty}\]
for all large $n$.

In the same way we can construct a map $a_n\:\spc{X}_n\to\spc{X}_\infty$ such that 
\[\dist{a_n(y)}{a_n(z)}{\spc{X}_\infty}+3\cdot\eps>\dist{y}{z}{\spc{X}_n}\]
Whence $\GHdist(\spc{X}_n,\spc{X}_\infty)\to 0$ as $n\to \infty$.

The following theorem roughly states that the isometry class of a Gromov--Hausdorff limit is uniquely defined once it is compact. 

\begin{thm}{Theorem} Let $\spc{X}_1,\spc{X}_2,\dots$ and $\spc{X}_\infty$ and $\bar{\spc{X}}_\infty$ be metric spaces
such that $\spc{X}_n\xto{\GH}\spc{X}_\infty$, 
$\spc{X}_n\xto{\bar\GH}\bar{\spc{X}}_\infty$.

Assume that $\bar{\spc{X}}_\infty$ is compact.
Then $\spc{X}_\infty\iso \bar{\spc{X}}_\infty$.
\end{thm}


\parit{Proof.}
For each point $x_\infty\in\spc{X}_\infty$,
choose its liftings $x_n\in\spc{X}_n$.

Choose a nonprincipal ultrafilter $\o$ on $\mathbb N$.
Define $\bar x_\infty\in \bar{\spc{X}}_\infty$ as the $\o$-limit of $x_n$ with respect to $\bar \tau$.
We claim that the map $x_\infty\to \bar x_\infty$ is an isometry.

Indeed, by to the definition of Gromov--Hausdorff convergence, 
\[\dist{\bar x_\infty}{\bar y_\infty}{\bar{\spc{X}}_\infty}
=
\lim_{n\to\o}\dist{x_n}{y_n}{\spc{X}_n}
=
\dist{x_\infty}{y_\infty}{\spc{X}_\infty}.
\]
Thus, the map $x_\infty\to\bar x_\infty$ gives a distance preserving map
$\map\:\spc{X}_\infty\hookrightarrow\bar{\spc{X}}_\infty$.
In particular,  
$\spc{X}_\infty$ is compact.
Switching $\spc{X}_\infty$ and $\bar{\spc{X}}_\infty$ and applying the same argument, 
we get an isometric embedding 
$\bar{\spc{X}}_\infty\hookrightarrow\spc{X}_\infty$.
Now the result follows from Lemma~\ref{lem:>=-isometry}.

\begin{thm}{Exercise}
Let $\spc{X}_n$ be a sequence of metric spaces that admits 
two Gromov--Hausdorff convergences
$\GH$ and $\GH'$.
Assume 
$\spc{X}_n\xGHto{\GH}\spc{X}_\infty$ and $\spc{X}_n\xGHto{\GH'}\spc{X}_\infty'$.
Show that if $\spc{X}_\infty$ is proper and there is a sequence of points $x_n\in \spc{X}_n$ 
that converges in both
$\GH$ and $\GH'$, then $\spc{X}_\infty\iso\spc{X}_\infty'$.
