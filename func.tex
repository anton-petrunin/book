\chapter{Maps and functions}

Here we introduce some classes of maps between metric spaces and develop a language to describe different levels of convexity/concavity of real-valued functions on general metric space.

Changing sign changes a concave function into a convex function and other way around.
Concave functions are used mainly in the $\CBB{}{}$-spaces,
while convex ones are used  mainly in $\Cat{}{}$-spaces.



\section{Maps, functions and relatives}

We will often need maps and functions defined on subsets of a metric space. We call them \emph{submaps} and \emph{subfunction}\index{submap}\index{subfunction}.
Thus given a metric space $\spc{X}$ and $\spc{Y}$, 
a submap $\map\:\spc{X}\subto \spc{Y}$ is a map defined on a subset $\Dom\map\subset \spc{X}$.

Almost all subfunctions and sub maps we consider are continuous (or at least semicontinuous).
In this case the domain $\Dom\map$ is automatically open.
Indeed, the continuous maps are defined as those for which preimage of open set is open.
Assume $\map\:\spc{X}\subto \spc{Y}$ is a continuous submap.
Since $\spc{Y}$ is open then so is $\map^{-1}(\spc{Y})$ 
which is the same as $\Dom \map$.
The same is true for upper and lower semicontinuous functions $f\:\spc{X}\subto \RR$ since it is a continuous function for special topology on $\RR$.

\begin{thm}{Isometry}
Let $\spc{X}$ and $\spc{Y}$ be metric spaces
and $\map\:\spc{X}\to \spc{Y}$ be a map
\begin{subthm}{}
The map $\map$ is \emph{distance preserving}\index{distance preserving map} if
$$|\map(x)-\map(x')|_{\spc{Y}}=|x-x'|_{\spc{X}}$$
for any $x,x'\in X$.
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{}
A distance preserving bijection $\map$ is called an \emph{isometry}\index{isometry}.
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{}
The spaces $X$ and $Y$ are called \emph{isometric}\index{isometric spaces} (briefly $X\iso Y$)
 if there is an isometry  $\map\:X\to Y$.
\end{subthm}

\end{thm}


\begin{thm}{Lipschitz maps}
Let $\spc{X}$ and $\spc{Y}$ be metric spaces 
$\map\:\spc{X}\subto\spc{Y}$ be a submap 
and $\Lip\in\RR$.

\begin{subthm}{}
The submap $\map$ is called \emph{$\Lip$-Lipschitz}\index{$\Lip$-Lipschitz map} if
\[\dist{\map(x)}{\map(y)}{\spc{Y}}
\le
\Lip\cdot
\dist{x}{y}{\spc{X}}\]  
for any two points $x,y\in\Dom \map$.

\begin{itemize}
 \item The $1$-Lipschitz maps will be also called \emph{short}\index{short map}.
\end{itemize}

\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{}
We say that $\map$ is \emph{Lipschitz}\index{Lipschitz map} if it is $\Lip$-Lipschitz for some constant $\Lip$.
The minimal such constant is denoted by $\lip\map$.
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{}
We say that $\map$ is \emph{locally Lipschitz}\index{locally Lipschitz map} 
if any point $x\in\Dom \map$ admits a neighborhood 
$\Omega\subset \Dom\map$ such that the restriction $\map|\Omega$ is Lipschitz.
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{}
Given $p\in\Dom \map$, we denote by $\lip_p\map$ the infimum of the real values $\Lip$ such that
$p$ admits  a neighborhood 
$\Omega\subset \Dom\map$ such that the restriction $\map|\Omega$ is $\Lip$-Lipschitz.
\end{subthm}
\end{thm}

Note that $\map\:\spc{X}\to\spc{Y}$ is $\Lip$-Lipschitz if
\[\map(\oBall(x, R)_{\spc{X}})\subset\oBall(\map(x),\Lip\cdot R)_{\spc{Y}}\]
for any $R\ge 0$ and $x\in \spc{X}$.
The following definition gives a dual version of it.

\begin{thm}{Definitions}
Let $\spc{X}$ and $\spc{Y}$ be metric spaces, 
$\map\:\spc{X}\to\spc{Y}$ be a map 
and $\Lip\in\RR$.
\begin{subthm}{}
The map $\map$ is called \emph{$\Lip$-co-Lipshitz}\index{$\Lip$-co-Lipshitz map} if 
\[\map(\oBall(x,\Lip\cdot R)_{\spc{X}})\supset\oBall(\map(x),R)_{\spc{Y}}\]
for any $x\in \spc{X}$ and $R>0$.
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{}
The map $\map$ is called \emph{co-Lipshitz}\index{co-Lipshitz map} if it is $\Lip$-co-Lipshitz
for some constant $\Lip$.
The minimal such constant is denoted by $\colip\map$.
\begin{itemize}
 \item The map $\map$ is called \emph{submetry}\index{submetry} if it is short and 1-co-Lipschitz.
\end{itemize}

\end{subthm}
\end{thm}

The $\Lip$-co-Lipschitz maps 
can be considered as a quantitative version of open maps.
By that reason they also called $\Lip$-open; see \cite{BGP}.
Also, be aware that some authors, 
refer to our $\Lip$-co-Lipschitz maps
as to $\tfrac1\Lip$-co-Lipschitz;
see ???.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}
Any co-Lipschits map is open and surjective.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.} Follows from the definition directly.
\qeds

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:colip=>complete}
Let $\spc{X}$ and $\spc{Y}$ be metric spaces and
$\map\: \spc{X}\to\spc{Y}$ is a continuous co-Lipschitz map 
Then $\spc{Y}$ is complete.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Choose a converging in itself sequence $y_1,y_2,\dots$ in $\spc{Y}$.
Passing to a subsequence if nececury, we may assume that $\dist{y_n}{y_{n+1}}{\spc{Y}}< \tfrac1{2^n}$ for each $n$.

Denote by $\Lip$ a co-Lipschitz constant of $\map$.
Note that  there is a sequence $x_1,x_2,\dots$ in $\spc{X}$
such that
\[\map(x_n)=y_n\ \ \text{and}\ \ \dist{x_n}{x_{n+1}}{\spc{X}}< \tfrac{\Lip}{2^n}.\eqlbl{eq:colip+1/2n}\]
for each $n$. 
Indeed, such a sequence $(x_n)$ can be constructed recursively. 
Assuming that the points $x_1,\dots,x_{n-1}$ are already constructed, 
the existence of $x_n$ satisfying \ref{eq:colip+1/2n}
follows since $\map$ is $\Lip$-co-Lipschitz.

Notice that $(x_n)$ converges in itself in $\spc{X}$.
Denote by $x_\infty$ its limit
and set $y_\infty= \map(x_\infty)$.
Since $\map$ is continuous,
$y_n\to y_\infty$ as $n\to\infty$.
Hence the result follows.

\section{Sumbetry}\label{sec:quotient-CBB}

A map $\sigma\:\spc{L}\to\spc{M}$ between the metric spaces $\spc{L}$ and $\spc{M}$
is called 
\emph{submetry}\index{submetry} if 
\[\sigma(\oBall(p,r)_\spc{L})=\oBall(\sigma(p),r)_{\spc{M}}\]
for any $p\in \spc{L}$ and $r\ge 0$.

Equivalently, a map $\sigma\:\spc{L}\to\spc{M}$ is called sumbetry if it is 1-Lipshitz and 1-co-Lipschitz at the same time.

Note that any submetry is an onto map.

The main souse of examples of submetries comes from isometric group actions.

Nemely, assume $\spc{L}$ is a metric space and the group $G$ acts on $\spc{L}$.
Denote by $\spc{L}/G$ the set of $G$-orbits;
let us equip it with the Hausdorff metric. 

In general, $\spc{L}/G$ is a premetric space,
but if all the $G$-orbits form closed sets in $\spc{L}$
then $\spc{L}/G$ is a metric space.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:submet/G}
Let $\spc{L}$ be a metric space and group $G$  acts on $\spc{L}$ by isometries  
and in such a way that every $G$-orbit is closed.
Then the projection map $\spc{L}\to \spc{L}/G$ is a sumbetry.
\end{thm}

%???should it be proved???


\begin{thm}{Proposition}
\label{prop:submet-length}
Let  $\spc{L}$ be a length space 
and $\sigma\:\spc{L}\to \spc{M}$ is a submetry.
Then $\spc{M}$ is a length space.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Fix $\eps>0$ and a pair of points $x,y\in \spc{M}$.

Since $\sigma$ is $1$-co-Lipschitz, there are points $\hat x,\hat y\in \spc{L}$
such that $\sigma(\hat x)=x$, $\sigma(\hat y)=y$ 
and $\dist{\hat x}{\hat y}{\spc{L}}<\dist{x}{y}{\spc{M}}+\eps$.

Since ${\spc{L}}$ is a length space, 
there is a curve $\gamma$ 
joining $\hat x$ to $\hat y$ in ${\spc{L}}$
such that
\[\length\gamma\le \dist{x}{y}{\spc{M}}+\eps.\]

Since $\sigma$ is $1$-Lipschitz,
there 
\[\length\sigma\circ\gamma\le \length\gamma.\]

Note that the curve $\sigma\circ\gamma$ joins $x$ to $y$
and from above
\[\length\sigma\circ\gamma<\dist{x}{y}{\spc{M}}+\eps.\]
Since $\eps>0$ is arbitrary,
we have that $\spc{M}$ is a length space.
\qeds

\section{Speed of curves}

Let $\spc{X}$ be a metric space.
A \emph{curve}\index{curve} in $\spc{X}$ is a continuous map $\alpha\:\II\to \spc{X}$, where $\II$ is a \emph{real interval}\index{real interval} (that is, an arbitrary convex subset of $\RR$);
the curve it called \emph{Lipschitz}\index{Lipschitz curve} or \emph{locally Lipschitz}\index{locally Lipschitz curve} if the map $\alpha\:\II\to \spc{X}$ is.

%??? Maybe we only need locally Lipschitz curves, A.???

The length of the curve $\alpha\:\II\to \spc{X}$, 
is defined by
\[\length\alpha=\sup\set{\sum_n\dist{\alpha(t_{n-1})}{\alpha(t_n)}{\spc{X}}}{t_0<t_1<\dots<t_\kay}.\]
The following lemma is an easy exercise.
%The same definition works for arbitrary map $\alpha\:\II\to \spc{X}$, not necessary continuous.

\begin{thm}{Lower semicontinuity of length}\label{thm:semicont-of-length}
Assume $\alpha_n\:\II\to \spc{X}$ is a sequence of curves which converges pointwise to a curve $\alpha_\infty\:\II\to \spc{X}$.
Then 
\[\length\alpha_\infty\le \liminf_{n\to\infty}\length\alpha_n.\]

\end{thm}



The following theorem follows from \cite[2.7.4]{BBI}.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:speed}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a metric space  
and $\alpha\:\II \to \spc{X}$ be a locally Lipschitz
curve. 
Then the speed function
\[\speed\alpha(t_0)=\lim_{t\to t_0}\frac{\dist{\alpha(t)}{\alpha(t_0)}{}}{|t-t_0|}\] 
is defined for almost all $t_0 \in \II$ and 
\[\length\alpha=\int\limits_\II \speed\alpha(t)\cdot\d t,\]
where $\int$ denotes the Lebesgue integral.
\end{thm}

A curve $\alpha\:\II\to\spc{X}$ is called \emph{unit-speed curve}\index{unit-speed curve}, 
if for any subinterval $[a,b]\subset\II$, we have
\[b-a=\length(\alpha|[a,b]).\]
According to the above theorem, this is equivalent to the condition that $\alpha$ is Lipschitz and $\speed\alpha\ae 1$.

The following theorem from \cite{kirchheim} %CHECK??? 
generalize the one above.


\begin{thm}{Theorem}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a metric space 
and $f\:\RR^n \subto \spc{X}$ be $1$-Lipschitz. 
Then for almost all $x\in\Dom f$ there is a prenorm $\lVert*\rVert_x$ on $\RR^n$ such that
we have
\[\dist{f(y)}{f(z)}{\spc{X}}=\lVert z-y\rVert_x+o(|y-x|+|z-x|).\]
Moreover if $s(x)=\sup\set{\tfrac{\lVert w\rVert_x}{|w|}}{w\not=0}$ then 
\[\HausMes_n[\Im f] \le \int\limits_{\Dom f}s(x).\]
\end{thm}


The norm $\lVert*\rVert_x$ in the above theorem 
will be called \emph{differential of induced metric} at $x$.

\section{Convexity of real-to-real functions}\label{sec:conv-real}

We will be interested in the solutions
of the following differential inequalities
\[y''+\kappa\cdot  y\ge \lambda
\ \ \t{(and respectively}
\ \ y''+\kappa\cdot  y\le \lambda\t{)}\eqlbl{eq:sec:conv-real*}\]
for fixed $\kappa,\lambda\in\RR$.
The solution $y\:\RR\subto\RR$ are only assumed to be lower%???
 (respectively upper%???
) semicontinuous subfunctions.

The inequalities  \ref{eq:sec:conv-real*} are understood in the sense of distributions.
I.e., for any smooth function $\phi$ with compact support $\supp\phi\subset\Dom y$ the following inequality should be satisfied:
\[\int\limits_{\Dom y}\l[y(t)\cdot\phi''(t)+\kappa\cdot  y(t)\cdot\phi(t)-\lambda\r]\cdot\d t
\ge 0\ \ \t{(and respectively}\ \ \le0\t{)}.
\eqlbl{eq:distr-conc}\]
The integral is understood in the sense of Lebesgue,
in particular the inequality \ref{eq:distr-conc}
makes sense for any Borel-measurable subfunction $y$.


\begin{thm}{Proposition}
Let $\II\subset\RR$ is an open interval and $y_n\:\II\to\RR$ be a sequence of solutions of one of the inequality in \ref{eq:sec:conv-real*}.
Assume $y_n(t)\to y_\infty(t)$ as $n\to\infty$ for any $t\in \II$.
Then $y_\infty$ is a solution of the same inequality in \ref{eq:sec:conv-real*}.
\end{thm}

Assume $y$ is a solution of one of the inequality in \ref{eq:sec:conv-real*}.
For $t_0\in \Dom y$, let us define right (left) derivative $y^+(t_0)$ ($y^-(t_0)$) at $t_0$ by
\[y^\pm(t_0)=\lim_{t\to t_0\pm} \frac{y(t)-y(t_0)}{|t-t_0|}.\]
The sign convention we use for $y^-$ is not standard, thus for $y(t)=t$ we have
$y^\pm(t)=\pm 1$.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:derivative-of-convex-function}
Let $\II\subset\RR$ is an open interval and $y_n\:\II\to\RR$ be a sequence of solutions of one of the inequality in \ref{eq:sec:conv-real*}.
Then right  and left derivatives $y^+(t_0)$ and $y^-(t_0)$ are defined
for any $t_0\in\II$.
\end{thm}


The next theorem gives a  number of equivalent ways to define such a generalized solution.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{y''=<1-ky}
Let $\II$ be an open real interval and $y\:\II\to\RR$ be a locally Lipschitz function
then the following conditions are equivalent:
\begin{subthm}{}$y''\ge \lambda-\kappa\cdot  y$ (respectively $y''\le \lambda-\kappa\cdot  y)$
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{barrier}(barrier inequality) For any $t_0\in \II$, 
there is a solution $\bar y$ 
of ordinary differential equation $\bar y''=\lambda-\kappa\cdot  \bar y$ 
with $\bar y(t_0)= y(t_0)$ such that $\bar y\ge y$ (respectively $\bar y\le y$) for all $t\in [t_0-\varpi\kappa,t_0+\varpi\kappa]\cap \II$.

The function $\bar y$ is called \emph{lower} (respectively \emph{upper}) \emph{barrier} of $y$ at $t_0$\index{barrier}.
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{barrier'} 
Suppose $y''\le \lambda-\kappa\cdot  y$ . Let $t_0\in\II$ and let  $\bar y$ be a solution of  the
 ordinary differential equation $\bar y''=\lambda-\kappa\cdot  \bar y$ 
such that  $\bar y(t_0)= y(t_0)$ and $y^+(t_0)\le y(t_0)\le -y^-(t_0)$. (note that such $\bar{y}$ is unique if $y$ is differentiable at $t_0$). 

Then $\bar y\ge y$  for all $t\in [t_0-\varpi\kappa,t_0+\varpi\kappa]\cap \II$; that is $\bar{y}$ is a barrier of $y$ at $t_0$.
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{y''-mono} (Jensen's inequality)\index{Jensen's inequality}
For any pair of values $t_1<t_2$ in $\II$, such that $|t_2-t_1|<\varpi\kappa$ the unique solutions $z(t)$ of \[z''\z=\lambda-\kappa\cdot  z\] such that
\[z(t_1)=y(t_1),\ \ z(t_2)=y(t_2)\] 
satisfies $y(t)\le z(t)$ (respectively $y(t)\ge z(t)$) for all $t\in[t_1,t_2]$.
\end{subthm}
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.} It is left to the reader.\qeds


We will often need the following simple fact about convergence of derivative of convex functions:

\begin{thm}{Lemma on equilibrium}\label{lem:der-conv-lim}
Let $\II$ be an open interval 
and $f_n\:\II\to\RR$ be a sequence of concave functions. 
Assume the functions $f_n$ pointwise converge to a function $f\:\II\to\RR$.
Then for any $t_0\in \II$,
\[f^\pm(t_0)\le \liminf_{n\to\infty}f^\pm_n(t_0).\]
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Since $f_n$ are convex, we have $f^+_n(t_0)+f^-_n(t_0)\ge0$, and for any $t$,
\[f_n(t)\ge f_n(t_0)\pm f^\pm(t_0)\cdot (t-t_0).\]
Passing to the limit, we get
\[f(t)\ge f(t_0)+\l[\limsup_{n\to\infty}f^+_n(t_0)\r]\cdot (t-t_0)\]
for $t\ge t_0$, and 
\[f(t)\ge f(t_0)-\l[\limsup_{n\to\infty}f^-_n(t_0)\r]\cdot (t-t_0)\]
for $t\le t_0$.
Hence the result.
\qeds

\begin{thm}{Corollary}
\label{cor:der-conv-lim}
Let $\II$ be an open interval 
and $f_n\:\II\to\RR$ be a sequence of functions which satisfy $f_n''\le \lambda$ and converge pointwise to a function $f\:\II\to\RR$.
Then: 
\begin{subthm}{} If $f$ is differentiable at $t_0\in \II$, then
\[f'(t_0)=\pm\lim_{n\to\infty} f^\pm_n(t_0).\]
\end{subthm}

\begin{subthm}{} If all $f_n$ and $f$ are differentiable at $t_0\in \II$, then
\[f'(t_0)=\lim_{n\to\infty} f'_n(t_0).\]
\end{subthm}
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.} Set $\hat f_n(t)=f_n(t)-\tfrac{\lambda}{2}\cdot t^2$ and $\hat f(t)=f(t)-\tfrac\lambda2\cdot t^2$.
Note that $\hat f_n$ are concave and $\hat f_n\to \hat f$ pointwise.
Thus, theorem follows from the lemma on equilibrium (\ref{lem:der-conv-lim}).\qeds











\section{Convexity of functions on metric space.}\label{sec:conv-fun}

Although the following definitions has sense for general metric space,
it only defines reasonable  classes of function for reasonable spaces --- Alexandrov spaces are included.

\begin{thm}{Definition}\label{def:lam-convex}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a metric space.
A subfunction $f\:\spc{X}\subto(-\infty,\infty]$ is called \emph{semiconvex}\index{semiconvex}
if 
for any point $p\in \Dom f$ there is $\lambda\in\RR$ and a neighborhood $\Omega_p\subset \Dom f$ 
such for any unit-speed geodesic $\gamma$ in $\Omega_p$ 
the real-to-real function $t\mapsto f\circ\gamma(t)-\tfrac{\lambda}{2}\cdot t^2$ is convex.


A subfunction $f\:\spc{X}\subto[-\infty,\infty)$ is called \emph{semiconcave}\index{semiconcave} 
if the subfunction $(-f)$ is semiconvex.
\end{thm}

Further, we give a meaning of certain type of second order ordinary differential inequalities in context of metric spaces.

\begin{thm}{Definition}\label{def:f''}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a metric space 
and $\phi\:\RR^2\to\RR$ be a Lipschitz function.
Given a semiconvex (semiconcave) subfunction $f\:\spc{X}\subto\bar\RR$, we will write
\[f''\ge \phi(f,|f'|)\ \ \l(\t{correspondingly}\ \  f''\le \phi(f,|f'|)\ \r)\]
if for any geodesic $\gamma$ in $\Dom f$ the real-to-real function $y=f\circ\gamma$
satisfies the differential inequality
\[y''\ge \phi(y,|y'|)\ \ \l(\t{correspondingly}\ \  y''\le \phi(y,|y'|)\r)\]
in the sense of ???.
\end{thm}

%??? ADD strict inequalities???

For $\lambda\in\RR$, the solutions of differential inequalities 
\[f''\ge \lambda \ \ \t{and}\ \ f''\le\lambda\]
will be called correspondingly \emph{$\lambda$-convex}\index{$\lambda$-convex} and \emph{$\lambda$-concave}\index{$\lambda$-concave} subfunctions.
If $\lambda=0$,
$0$-convex and $0$-concave subfunctions will be also called \emph{convex} and \emph{concave} correspondingly.
If $f$ is $\lambda$-convex for some $\lambda>0$ it will be called \emph{strongly convex};
correspondingly if $f$ is $\lambda$-concave for some $\lambda<0$ it will be called \emph{strongly concave}.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:conv-comp}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a metric space.
Assume that $f\:\spc{X}\subto \RR$ is a semiconvex subfunction
and $\phi\:\RR\to\RR$ is a nondecreasing seimconvex function.
Then the composition $\phi\circ f$ is a semiconvex subfunction.
\end{thm}


\parbf{NB!}
Various authors define the class of $\lambda$-convex ($\lambda$-concave) function differently. 
It may correspond to $\pm\lambda$-convex ($\pm\lambda$-concave) or $\pm\tfrac\lambda2$-convex ($\pm\tfrac\lambda2$-concave) function in our definitions.

\medskip

Further, two classes of functions, satisfying differential inequalities
\[f''\ge \lambda-\kappa\cdot  f
\ \ \text{and}\ \ 
f''\le \lambda-\kappa\cdot  f\]
will play a very important role.
The solutions of these differential inequalities should be understood to possess a special form of convexity and concavity that is optimized to reflect properties of spaces with curvature $\le \kappa$ and $\ge\kappa$.  
If $\kappa\not=0$,
by adding the constant $-\lambda/\kappa$ to these solutions, we obtain the solutions of the differential inequalities
\[f''\ge -\kappa\cdot  f
\ \ \text{and}\ \ 
f''\le -\kappa\cdot  f,\]
which also arise naturally.

\begin{thm}{Convexity of the limit}

 
\end{thm}


Tietze extension theorem???

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:lip-approx}
Let $\spc{X}$ be a metric space and $f\:\spc{X}\to\RR$ be a continuous function.
Then for any $\eps>0$ there is a locally Lipschitz function $f_\eps\:\spc{X}\to\RR$
such that $|f(x)-f_\eps(x)|<\eps$ for any $x\in \spc{X}$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Assume that $f\ge 1$.
Construct a continous positive function $\rho\:\spc{X}\to \RR_{>0}$ such that 
\[\dist{x}{y}{}<\rho(x)\ \ \Rightarrow\ \ |f(x)-f(y)|<\eps.\]
Consider function
\[
f_\eps(x)
=
\sup\set{f(x)
\cdot
\l(1-\tfrac{\dist{x}{y}{}}{\rho(x)}\r)}%
{x\in\spc{X}}.
\]
It is straightforward to check that each $f_\eps$ is locally Lipschtz and $0\le f_\eps-f<\eps$.

Note that any continuous function can be presented as difference of two continuous functions bounded below by $1$.
Hence the result.
