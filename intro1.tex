\chapter*{Introduction}

In this book, the term Alexandrov space will refer to one of the following types of %complete 
metric spaces:
\begin{itemize}
\item spaces with curvature bounded below;
\item spaces with curvature bounded above;
\item spaces with two-sided bounded curvature.
\end{itemize}
All these classes of spaces are defined using metric comparison to a model space, without using any analytical tools. 

The goal of this book is to give a comprehensive description of theory of Alexandrov spaces with curvature bounded below (CBB);  and in the theory of Alexandrov spaces with curvature bounded above (CBA), about which more is currently available in book form, to cover all the basic material as well as selected topics inspired by considering the two contexts simultaneously.  Although the two fields developed quite independently, they have many similar guiding intuitions and technical tools.  Our approach is novel in its attention to the interrelatedness of the two fields, and its emphasis on the way each illuminates the other.  We only consider inner theory, leaving most applications aside.


\section*{History}

The first synthetic description of curvature is due to Abraham Wald; 
it was given in a lonely publication on a ``coordinateless description of Gauss surfaces'' published in 1936, see \cite{wald}.
In 1941, similar definitions were rediscovered independently by Aleksandr Danilovich Aleksandrov,
see \cite{alexandrov:def}.
In Alexandrov's work the first fruitful applications of this approach were given.
Mainly:
\begin{itemize}
\item Alexandrov's embedding theorem  --- 
\textit{metrics of non-negative curvature on the sphere, and only they, are isometric to closed convex surfaces in Euclidean 3-space}. This theorem appears first in \cite{alexandrov:def} and latter in the book \cite{alexandrov-embedding}.
\item Gluing theorem, which gave a flexible tool to modify non-negativly curved metrics on a sphere, see \cite{alexandrov-glueing}.
\end{itemize}
These two results together gave  a very intuitive geometric tool to study embeddings and bending of surfaces in Euclidean space, and changed this subject dramatically.

In 

These theorems formed the foundation of branch of geometry called Alexandrov geometry.
One could use ``back to Euclid'' as a slogan for this new brach of geometry;
first it develops in Soviet Union but soon spreads to the rest of the world.

Here is a list of available introductions to the Alexandrov spaces with curvature bounded below: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \cite{BGP} and its extension \cite{perelman:spaces2} is the first introduction to Alexandrov's geometry. 
Some parts of it are not easy to read. 
In the English translation of \cite{BGP} there were invented some militaristic terms, which no one ever used;  in particular, \emph{burst point} should be \emph{strained point} and \emph{explosion} should be \emph{array of strainers}.
\item \cite{shiohama} intoduction to Alexandrov's geometry, designed to be reader-friendly. 
\item \cite{plaut:survey} A survey in Alexandrov's geometry 
written for topologists. 
The first 8 sections can be used as an introduction, but it is  a bit brief.
\item \cite[Chapter 10]{BBI} is yet another reader-friendly introduction.
\end{itemize}


\parbf{Curvature bounded below.}
Big attention was given to 
the two-dimensional spaces with curvature bounded below.
Here one should mention the work of Iosif Liberman,
a student of Alexandrov who died in the war soon after defense of his doctoral thesis in 1941.
In his thesis he first used the notion of development, 
a construction influenced the development of Alexandrov geometry, both with curvature bounded below and above.
We should also mention the new proof of Alexandrov embedding theorem which is due to ??? Volkov.
An outstanding work was done later by Aleksey Vasilyevich Pogorelov 
among other thing he proved uniqueness of convex surface with given length metric up to motion of the Euclidean space.

Untill 80's,
Alexandrov geometry with curvature bounded above
was developing in the 2-dimensional case only.
We see only two exceptions:
\begin{itemize}
\item The work of Anatoliy Dmitrievich Milka, 
who started to consider multidimensional Alexandrov's spaces with lower curvature bound in 60's;
Milka used the global definition similarly to what we do in this book.
In particular he proved the splitting theorem for such spaces.
\item The work of Bruce Kleiner on non-negatively curved manifolds with infinite group of symmetries.
Although
formally speaking he did not used Alexandrov geometry, these
give the first application of Alexandrov geometry in dimension grater than 2.
\end{itemize}

In the 80's the interest in convergence of Riemannian manifolds created by Gromov's compactness theorem (\cite{gomov-precompactness}) turned attention toward the singular spaces that can occur as limits of Riemannian manifolds. 
Immediately it was recognized that if the manifolds have a uniform lower sectional curvature bound, then the limit spaces have a lower curvature bound in the sense of Alexandrov. 
There followed throughout the 90's an explosion of work starting with papers of Yurij Dmitrievich Burago, Grigori Yakovlevich Perelman and Mikhail Leonidovich Gromov  \cite{BGP} and \cite{perelman:spaces2}.

The above activity was very much related to comparison geometry.
This approach is not that maximalistic --- it is classical differential geometry, 
mostly using comparison  to spaces of constant curvature.
In addition to the already-mentioned Gromov's compactness theorem,
the following results had a big influence on the development of Alexandrov's geometry:
\begin{itemize}
\item Toponogov comparison and splitting theorems
these are generalizations of Cohn-Vossen's theorem,
\item finiteness theorems of
Cheeger and
Grove--Petersen--Wu,
\item Yamaguchi fibration theorem.
\end{itemize}

\parbf{Curvature bounded above.}
The first use of this method for the spaces with lower curvature bound appear only in 1951, see \cite{alexandrov:strong-angle}.
Yet earlier a weaker definition was considered by Busemann in \cite{busemann-CBA}.

The fundamental results in this direction were obtained by Yurii Grigorievich Reshetnyak.
It includes his majorization theorem and gluing theorem.
The gluing theorem states that if two non-positively curved spaces have isometric convex sets, then the space obtained by gluing these sets along the isometry is also non-positively curved.

One of the most beautiful applications of the gluing theorem was given  recently by Dmitry Burago, Sergei Ferleger and Alexey Kanonenko in \cite{BFK};
in particular it gives an estimate for the number of collisions of a billiard without walls.

A spin off of the idea of synthetic definition of upper curvature bound 
was given by Gromov. 
He gave an analogous definition for discrete metric spaces, so called $\delta$-hyperbolic spaces. 
It provided an intuitive geometric tool for studying small cancellation groups.

Here is a list of available introductions to the Alexandrov spaces with curvature bounded above: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \cite{BH}
\item \cite{ballmann:lectures} Lecture notes of Werner Ballmann
\item \cite[Chapter 9]{BBI} a reader-friendly introduction.
\end{itemize}
